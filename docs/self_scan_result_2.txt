SECURITY ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

# Step-by-step analysis of the provided code:

### 1. SQL injection vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** The code does not contain any direct SQL injection vulnerabilities since it does not execute SQL queries.
*   **Fix:** Not required.

### 2. Command injection vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** The code does not contain any direct command injection vulnerabilities since it does not execute system commands.
*   **Fix:** Not required.

### 3. Path traversal issues

*   **Vulnerability:** The code uses `os.path.abspath(os.path.normpath(path))` to normalize paths, which helps prevent path traversal attacks.
*   **Fix:** The existing fix is sufficient.

### 4. Authentication and authorization flaws

*   **Vulnerability:** The code uses an API key for Cerebras client authentication, but it does not handle authentication or authorization for the scanned code.
*   **Fix:** Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for the scanned code if necessary.

### 5. Improper error handling and information leakage

*   **Vulnerability:** The code logs error messages, which may contain sensitive information.
*   **Fix:** Modify the logging configuration to handle sensitive information properly. Consider using a logging framework that supports log filtering and redaction.

### 6. Hardcoded secrets

*   **Vulnerability:** The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, but it loads an API key from the environment or a configuration file.
*   **Fix:** Ensure that the API key is stored securely, and consider using a secrets management system.

### 7. Insecure use of cryptographic functions

*   **Vulnerability:** The code does not contain any cryptographic functions.
*   **Fix:** Not required.

Other potential issues:

*   **Insecure deserialization:** The code uses `yaml.safe_load()` to load configuration files, which is secure. However, be cautious when using YAML deserialization, as it can be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution if not used securely.

## Specific vulnerabilities and fixes in the provided code:

### Insecure logging configuration

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
```

*   **Vulnerability:** The logging configuration may log sensitive information.
*   **Fix:** Modify the logging configuration to handle sensitive information properly:

```python
import logging

# Create a logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Set the logging level
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Create a file handler
file_handler = logging.FileHandler('cerebras_code_scanner.log')
file_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Create a formatter and add it to the file handler
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

# Add the file handler to the logger
logger.addHandler(file_handler)

# Create a console handler
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
console_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Create a formatter and add it to the console handler
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

# Add the console handler to the logger
logger.addHandler(console_handler)
```

### Potential path traversal in `save_results_to_file`

```python
def save_results_to_file(results, output_file="scan_results.md"):
    # Sanitize output file path
    output_file = os.path.abspath(os.path.normpath(output_file))
    
    try:
        with open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            # ...
```

*   **Vulnerability:** The output file path is not validated.
*   **Fix:** Validate the output file path to ensure it is within a safe directory:

```python
import os

def save_results_to_file(results, output_file="scan_results.md"):
    # Define a safe output directory
    safe_output_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.normpath('./results'))
    
    # Sanitize output file path
    output_file = os.path.abspath(os.path.normpath(output_file))
    
    # Check if the output file is within the safe directory
    if not output_file.startswith(safe_output_dir):
        logger.error("Invalid output file path")
        return
    
    try:
        with open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            # ...
```

### Potential issues with `load_config`

```python
def load_config(config_file='config.yaml'):
    try:
        with open(config_file, 'r') as file:
            return yaml.safe_load(file)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error(f"Config file '{config_file}' not found.")
        return {}
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error loading config: {e}")
        return {}
```

*   **Vulnerability:** The configuration file is not validated, and the `yaml.safe_load()` function may raise exceptions.
*   **Fix:** Validate the configuration file and handle exceptions properly:

```python
import yaml

def load_config(config_file='config.yaml'):
    try:
        with open(config_file, 'r') as file:
            config = yaml.safe_load(file)
            if config is None:
                config = {}
            return config
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error(f"Config file '{config_file}' not found.")
        return {}
    except yaml.YAMLError as e:
        logger.error(f"Error parsing YAML: {e}")
        return {}
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error loading config: {e}")
        return {}
```

### Potential issues with `analyze_code_security` and `analyze_code_performance`

```python
def analyze_code_security(code_snippet, model="llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct"):
    # ...
    
    try:
        chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
            # ...
```

*   **Vulnerability:** The Cerebras client API is not validated, and the API may raise exceptions.
*   **Fix:** Validate the Cerebras client API and handle exceptions properly:

```python
def analyze_code_security(code_snippet, model="llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct"):
    try:
        client = initialize_cerebras_client()
        
        # Validate the client API
        if not client:
            logger.error("Failed to initialize Cerebras client")
            return None
        
        chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
            # ...
```

## Conclusion

The provided code has some potential security vulnerabilities and issues, including insecure logging configuration, potential path traversal in `save_results_to_file`, and potential issues with `load_config`, `analyze_code_security`, and `analyze_code_performance`. By addressing these issues, you can improve the security and reliability of the code.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

# Performance Analysis:

The provided Python code appears to be a comprehensive code scanner that analyzes Python files for security and performance issues using Cerebras AI. However, there are a few potential performance issues and areas for improvement:

### 1. Inefficient Algorithms or Data Structures:

* The `should_ignore_path` function iterates over all patterns in the `.scanignore` file for each path. If the number of patterns is large, this could lead to performance issues. A more efficient approach would be to use a data structure like a trie or a suffix tree to store the patterns and quickly check if a path matches any of them.

### 2. Repeated Computations that Could be Cached:

* The `load_config` function is called multiple times throughout the code. If the configuration file is large or complex, this could lead to performance issues. Consider caching the configuration in memory after it's loaded.

### 3. Unnecessary Resource Usage:

* The `scan_directory` function opens and reads each Python file in the directory and its subdirectories. If the files are large, this could lead to high memory usage. Consider using a streaming approach to read and analyze the files.

### 4. Database Query Inefficiencies:

* There are no explicit database queries in the provided code. However, the `Cerebras` client is used to make API calls to analyze code. If these API calls are not properly optimized, it could lead to performance issues.

### 5. Memory Leaks or Excessive Memory Usage:

* The `scan_directory` function stores the results of the scan in memory before saving them to a file. If the directory contains a large number of files, this could lead to high memory usage. Consider using a streaming approach to process and save the results.

### 6. Threading or Concurrency Issues:

* The `scan_directory` function uses a single thread to scan all files in the directory and its subdirectories. If the directory contains a large number of files, this could lead to performance issues. Consider using multiple threads or processes to scan the files concurrently.

# Fixed Solution:

To address the performance issues mentioned above, consider the following optimizations:

### Optimize `should_ignore_path` Function

```python
import fnmatch

class ScanIgnore:
    def __init__(self, patterns):
        self.patterns = patterns
        self.dir_patterns = [p for p in patterns if p.endswith('/')]
        self.file_patterns = [p for p in patterns if not p.endswith('/')]

    def should_ignore_path(self, path):
        path_parts = path.split(os.sep)
        for pattern in self.dir_patterns:
            dir_pattern = pattern[:-1]
            for i in range(len(path_parts)):
                if fnmatch.fnmatch(path_parts[i], dir_pattern):
                    return True
        for pattern in self.file_patterns:
            if '/' in pattern:
                pattern_parts = pattern.split('/')
                if len(pattern_parts) <= len(path_parts):
                    match = True
                    for i, part in enumerate(pattern_parts):
                        if not fnmatch.fnmatch(path_parts[i], part):
                            match = False
                            break
                    if match:
                        return True
            else:
                if fnmatch.fnmatch(os.path.basename(path), pattern):
                    return True
        return False
```

### Cache Configuration

```python
_config = None

def load_config(config_file='config.yaml'):
    global _config
    if _config is not None:
        return _config
    try:
        with open(config_file, 'r') as file:
            _config = yaml.safe_load(file)
            return _config
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error(f"Config file '{config_file}' not found.")
        return {}
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error loading config: {e}")
        return {}
```

### Use Streaming Approach to Read and Analyze Files

```python
def scan_directory(directory_path, model="llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct"):
    config = load_config()
    results = {}
    
    # Load patterns from .scanignore
    ignore_patterns = load_scanignore()
    scan_ignore = ScanIgnore(ignore_patterns)
    
    # Get all Python files recursively
    for root, _, files in os.walk(directory_path):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.py'):
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                
                if should_scan_file(file_path, config, scan_ignore):
                    logger.info(f"Scanning {file_path}...")
                    
                    try:
                        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                            code = f.read()
                            
                        security_analysis = analyze_code_security(code, model)
                        performance_analysis = analyze_code_performance(code, model)
                        
                        results[file_path] = {
                            'security': security_analysis.choices[0].message.content if security_analysis else "Failed to analyze security issues",
                            'performance': performance_analysis.choices[0].message.content if performance_analysis else "Failed to analyze performance issues"
                        }
                    except Exception as e:
                        logger.error(f"Error processing {file_path}: {e}")
                        results[file_path] = {
                            'security': f"Error: {str(e)}",
                            'performance': f"Error: {str(e)}"
                        }
    
    return results
```

### Use Multiple Threads or Processes to Scan Files Concurrently

```python
import concurrent.futures

def scan_file(file_path, model, config, scan_ignore):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            code = f.read()
            
        security_analysis = analyze_code_security(code, model)
        performance_analysis = analyze_code_performance(code, model)
        
        return {
            'security': security_analysis.choices[0].message.content if security_analysis else "Failed to analyze security issues",
            'performance': performance_analysis.choices[0].message.content if performance_analysis else "Failed to analyze performance issues"
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error processing {file_path}: {e}")
        return {
            'security': f"Error: {str(e)}",
            'performance': f"Error: {str(e)}"
        }

def scan_directory(directory_path, model="llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct"):
    config = load_config()
    results = {}
    
    # Load patterns from .scanignore
    ignore_patterns = load_scanignore()
    scan_ignore = ScanIgnore(ignore_patterns)
    
    # Get all Python files recursively
    file_paths = []
    for root, _, files in os.walk(directory_path):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.py'):
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                if should_scan_file(file_path, config, scan_ignore):
                    file_paths.append(file_path)
                    
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = {executor.submit(scan_file, file_path, model, config, scan_ignore): file_path for file_path in file_paths}
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            file_path = futures[future]
            try:
                result = future.result()
                results[file_path] = result
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Error processing {file_path}: {e}")
                results[file_path] = {
                    'security': f"Error: {str(e)}",
                    'performance': f"Error: {str(e)}"
                }
    
    return results
```

# Explanation of Changes:

*   Replaced the `should_ignore_path` function with a `ScanIgnore` class that stores the patterns and provides a `should_ignore_path` method. This allows for more efficient matching of patterns.
*   Cached the configuration in memory after it's loaded to reduce the number of times the configuration file is read.
*   Used a streaming approach to read and analyze files to reduce memory usage.
*   Used multiple threads to scan files concurrently to improve performance.

# Tests and Example Uses:

To test the optimized code, you can use the following example:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    directory_path = "/path/to/directory"
    results = scan_directory(directory_path)
    display_results(results)
    save_results_to_file(results)
```

This will scan the specified directory and its subdirectories for Python files, analyze them for security and performance issues, display the results, and save them to a file.

SECURITY ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

**Security Analysis Report**
==========================

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

*   **Finding:** None
*   **Explanation:** The provided code does not appear to interact with a database, so there are no SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### 2. Command Injection Vulnerabilities

*   **Finding:** Yes
*   **Location:** `subprocess.call([sys.executable, "main.py", "--path", "sample_code"])` and `subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "-r", "requirements.txt"])`
*   **Explanation:** The `subprocess.call` and `subprocess.check_call` functions are used to execute system commands. While the arguments seem to be fixed in this case, using these functions can be insecure if the arguments are user-provided or unsanitized. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands.
*   **Fix:** 
    *   Use the `subprocess.run` function with the `shell=False` argument to prevent shell injection.
    *   Validate and sanitize any user-provided input.

Example:
```python
subprocess.run([sys.executable, "main.py", "--path", sample_dir], check=True, shell=False)
```

### 3. Path Traversal Issues

*   **Finding:** Yes
*   **Location:** `sample_dir = Path("sample_code")` and the `--path` argument in `subprocess.call([sys.executable, "main.py", "--path", "sample_code"])`
*   **Explanation:** The code uses a hardcoded path for the sample directory. However, if the `--path` argument is user-provided, an attacker could potentially exploit a path traversal vulnerability.
*   **Fix:**
    *   Use the `pathlib.Path.resolve()` method to resolve the path and prevent traversal.
    *   Validate and sanitize any user-provided input.

Example:
```python
import pathlib

# ...

sample_dir = pathlib.Path("sample_code").resolve()
if sample_dir.exists():
    # ...

# For user-provided paths
def validate_path(path):
    base_path = pathlib.Path.cwd().resolve()
    try:
        provided_path = pathlib.Path(path).resolve()
        if provided_path.is_relative_to(base_path):
            return provided_path
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid path")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid path provided")
        return None

# Usage
user_path = input("Enter a path: ")
validated_path = validate_path(user_path)
if validated_path:
    subprocess.run([sys.executable, "main.py", "--path", str(validated_path)], check=True, shell=False)
```

### 4. Authentication and Authorization Flaws

*   **Finding:** Yes
*   **Location:** `cerebras_api_key = os.environ.get("CEREBRAS_API_KEY")`
*   **Explanation:** The code checks for the presence of the `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` environment variable but does not validate or verify its authenticity. An attacker could potentially set a fake API key.
*   **Fix:**
    *   Validate the API key against a trusted source (e.g., Cerebras API).
    *   Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Example:
```python
import requests

def validate_api_key(api_key):
    try:
        response = requests.get("https://cerebras-api.com/validate-key", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"})
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error validating API key: {e}")
        return False

cerebras_api_key = os.environ.get("CEREBRAS_API_KEY")
if not validate_api_key(cerebras_api_key):
    print("Invalid API key")
```

### 5. Improper Error Handling and Information Leakage

*   **Finding:** Yes
*   **Location:** Multiple `except` blocks
*   **Explanation:** The code catches exceptions but prints error messages that could potentially leak information about the system or application.
*   **Fix:**
    *   Log errors instead of printing them.
    *   Use generic error messages.

Example:
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)

try:
    # ...
except Exception as e:
    logging.error("An error occurred")
    print("An error occurred")
```

### 6. Hardcoded Secrets

*   **Finding:** No
*   **Explanation:** The code does not contain hardcoded secrets.

### 7. Insecure Use of Cryptographic Functions

*   **Finding:** No
*   **Explanation:** The code does not appear to use cryptographic functions.

**Additional Recommendations:**
---------------------------

*   Consider using a secure method to store and manage API keys, such as a secrets manager.
*   Implement logging and monitoring to detect potential security issues.
*   Regularly update dependencies to ensure you have the latest security patches.
*   Use a secure protocol (e.g., HTTPS) for communication with external services.

**Updated Code:**
----------------

Here is an updated version of the code incorporating some of the recommended fixes:
```python
import os
import sys
import json
import subprocess
from pathlib import Path
import logging
import requests

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)

def validate_api_key(api_key):
    try:
        response = requests.get("https://cerebras-api.com/validate-key", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"})
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logging.error("Error validating API key")
        return False

def check_environment():
    cerebras_api_key = os.environ.get("CEREBRAS_API_KEY")
    if not cerebras_api_key:
        print("\033[93mWarning: CEREBRAS_API_KEY environment variable is not set.\033[0m")
        print("You can set it by running: export CEREBRAS_API_KEY=your-api-key-here")
        print("Alternatively, you can add it to the config.json file.")
        
        # Check if key is in config.json
        config_path = Path("config.json")
        if config_path.exists():
            try:
                with open(config_path, "r") as f:

--------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:
### 1. Inefficient algorithms or data structures
The provided code does not seem to have any complex algorithms that could be optimized. However, there are a few potential issues:

*   The `check_environment` function reads the `config.json` file and checks for the `cerebras_api_key`. If the file does not exist, it will throw an exception. This could be optimized by using a `try`-`except` block specifically for the `FileNotFoundError` exception.
*   The `install_dependencies` function uses `subprocess.check_call` to install dependencies. This function can be optimized by using the `pip` library directly.

### 2. Repeated computations that could be cached
There are no obvious repeated computations in the provided code that could be cached.

### 3. Unnecessary resource usage
The code uses `subprocess` to install dependencies and run a sample scan. This could potentially lead to unnecessary resource usage if the subprocesses are not properly managed.

### 4. Database query inefficiencies
There are no database queries in the provided code.

### 5. Memory leaks or excessive memory usage
The code reads the `config.json` file into memory, but this is not likely to cause memory issues unless the file is extremely large. There are no obvious memory leaks.

### 6. Threading or concurrency issues
The code does not use threading or concurrency, so there are no obvious issues in this area.

# Explanation of changes:
*   **Added a check for existing dependencies**: Before installing dependencies, the script now checks if they are already installed using the `are_dependencies_installed` function.
*   **Optimized `check_environment` function**: The function now uses a `try`-`except` block specifically for the `FileNotFoundError` exception when reading the `config.json` file.
*   **No changes to database queries**: There were no database queries in the original code, so no changes were made.
*   **No changes to threading or concurrency**: The original code did not use threading or concurrency, so no changes were made.

# Tests and example uses:
To test the script, you can run it in a Python environment where the `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` environment variable is not set. The script should print a warning message and suggest setting the environment variable or adding it to the `config.json` file.

You can also test the script by running it in an environment where the dependencies are not installed. The script should install the dependencies and then proceed with the rest of the setup.

```bash
# Test the script
python setup.py
```

Note that you will need to replace `setup.py` with the actual name of your script file.

**Best Practices:**

*   **Use a virtual environment**: It's a good practice to use a virtual environment when running Python scripts to isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects.
*   **Handle exceptions**: Make sure to handle exceptions properly to avoid crashes and provide useful error messages instead.
*   **Test your code**: Thoroughly test your code to ensure it works as expected in different scenarios.

SECURITY ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

**Security Vulnerability Analysis**

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** None found. The provided code does not appear to interact with a database or execute SQL queries.
*   **Fix:** N/A

### 2. Command Injection Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** The `argparse` library is used to parse command-line arguments, but the arguments are not used to execute system commands. However, there is a potential vulnerability if the `CodeAnalyzer` or `ReportGenerator` classes execute system commands using user-provided input.
*   **Fix:** Ensure that any system commands executed by the `CodeAnalyzer` or `ReportGenerator` classes are properly sanitized and validated to prevent command injection attacks.

### 3. Path Traversal Issues

*   **Vulnerability:** The `target_path` and `report_path` are resolved using the `Path.resolve()` method, which can help prevent path traversal attacks. However, the `args.path` and `args.output` arguments are not validated or sanitized.
*   **Fix:** Validate and sanitize the `args.path` and `args.output` arguments to prevent path traversal attacks. Consider using a whitelist approach to ensure that only allowed paths are accepted.

    ```python
import os

# ...

def main():
    # ...

    target_path = Path(args.path).resolve()
    if not target_path.is_relative_to(os.getcwd()):
        logger.error(f"Invalid path: {target_path}")
        sys.exit(1)

    report_path = Path(args.output).resolve()
    if not report_path.parent.is_relative_to(os.getcwd()):
        logger.error(f"Invalid report path: {report_path}")
        sys.exit(1)

    # ...
```

### 4. Authentication and Authorization Flaws

*   **Vulnerability:** The provided code does not appear to implement authentication or authorization mechanisms.
*   **Fix:** Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access and use the application.

### 5. Improper Error Handling and Information Leakage

*   **Vulnerability:** The `logger.error` statements reveal detailed information about errors, which could potentially be used by attackers to gain insight into the application's internal workings.
*   **Fix:** Implement a more robust error handling mechanism that logs errors without revealing sensitive information.

    ```python
import logging

# ...

def main():
    try:
        # ...
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error("An error occurred during the scan")
        # Log the exception without revealing sensitive information
        logger.exception(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    # ...
```

### 6. Hardcoded Secrets

*   **Vulnerability:** None found. However, the `config.json` file is loaded without any validation or sanitization.
*   **Fix:** Ensure that sensitive configuration values are not hardcoded and are properly secured. Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration storage mechanism.

### 7. Insecure Use of Cryptographic Functions

*   **Vulnerability:** None found. The provided code does not appear to use cryptographic functions.
*   **Fix:** N/A

**Additional Recommendations**

*   Consider implementing input validation and sanitization for all user-provided input.
*   Use a secure logging mechanism that logs errors and exceptions without revealing sensitive information.
*   Implement a robust authentication and authorization mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can access and use the application.
*   Regularly review and update dependencies to ensure that known vulnerabilities are patched.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

**Performance Analysis Report**

### Overview

The provided code appears to be a Python application designed to scan Python codebases for security vulnerabilities and performance issues using the Cerebras-hosted Llama 4 model. The code is generally well-structured, but there are some potential performance issues that can be optimized.

### Issues and Optimizations

#### 1. Inefficient Algorithms or Data Structures

*   **Issue:** The `scan_codebase` method of the `CodeAnalyzer` class is not shown in the provided code, but it's likely that it's scanning the codebase recursively. If it's using a recursive approach, it might be inefficient for large codebases.
*   **Optimization:** Consider using an iterative approach with a queue data structure to scan the codebase. This can help avoid potential stack overflow issues and improve performance.

#### 2. Repeated Computations that Could be Cached

*   **Issue:** The `load_config` function is called every time the `main` function is executed, which might involve loading and parsing a JSON file. If the configuration file doesn't change frequently, this can be optimized.
*   **Optimization:** Consider caching the configuration in a global variable or using a singleton pattern to load the configuration only once.

#### 3. Unnecessary Resource Usage

*   **Issue:** The `logger` object is set up with `setup_logging()`, but the logging level is not specified. This might lead to unnecessary log messages being generated.
*   **Optimization:** Consider setting the logging level based on the configuration or command-line arguments to control the verbosity of log messages.

#### 4. Database Query Inefficiencies

*   **Issue:** There is no database query in the provided code, but if the `CodeAnalyzer` or `ReportGenerator` classes interact with a database, inefficient queries might impact performance.
*   **Optimization:** Consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool like SQLAlchemy or Django's ORM to optimize database queries.

#### 5. Memory Leaks or Excessive Memory Usage

*   **Issue:** The `results` variable stores the scan results, which might be large for big codebases. If not handled properly, this can lead to excessive memory usage.
*   **Optimization:** Consider processing the scan results in chunks or using a streaming approach to generate the report, rather than loading the entire results into memory.

#### 6. Threading or Concurrency Issues

*   **Issue:** The provided code appears to be single-threaded, which might not be optimal for large codebases or computationally intensive tasks.
*   **Optimization:** Consider using multi-threading or multi-processing to parallelize the scanning process. This can significantly improve performance for large codebases.

### Code-Specific Suggestions

*   **Use a `try`-`except` block** to handle potential exceptions when loading the configuration or scanning the codebase.
*   **Validate user input** (e.g., `args.path`, `args.output`, `args.config`) to prevent potential errors or security issues.
*   **Consider using a more efficient JSON parser** like `ujson` or `jsonpickle` if the configuration file is large.

### Example Optimizations

Here's an updated version of the `main` function with some optimizations:

```python
import logging
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def main():
    """Main entry point for the application."""
    args = parse_arguments()
    
    # Load configuration with caching
    config = load_config(args.config)
    
    # Initialize the code analyzer
    analyzer = CodeAnalyzer(config)
    
    # Scan the codebase with multi-threading
    target_path = Path(args.path).resolve()
    if not target_path.exists():
        logger.error(f"Path does not exist: {target_path}")
        sys.exit(1)
        
    logger.info(f"Scanning codebase at: {target_path}")
    
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        results = analyzer.scan_codebase(target_path, categories=args.categories, executor=executor)
    
    # Generate report
    report_generator = ReportGenerator()
    report_path = Path(args.output).resolve()
    report_generator.generate_report(results, report_path)
    
    logger.info(f"Scan complete. Report saved to: {report_path}")
    
    # Print summary
    print(f"\nScan Summary:")
    print(f"  Files scanned: {results['stats']['files_scanned']}")
    print(f"  Issues found: {results['stats']['total_issues']}")
    print(f"  Report saved to: {report_path}")
```

In the `CodeAnalyzer` class:

```python
class CodeAnalyzer:
    # ...

    def scan_codebase(self, target_path, categories=None, executor=None):
        # ...

        if executor:
            # Use multi-threading to scan files in parallel
            with executor:
                results = list(executor.map(self.scan_file, file_paths))
        else:
            # Fallback to single-threaded scanning
            results = [self.scan_file(file_path) for file_path in file_paths]

        # ...
```

Note that these optimizations assume that the `CodeAnalyzer` and `ReportGenerator` classes are designed to work with multi-threading or multi-processing. You may need to modify these classes to support concurrent execution.

SECURITY ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

### Security Analysis Report

The provided code is a Python application designed to scan SQL queries for performance issues. After analyzing the code, the following security vulnerabilities and issues were identified:

#### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** None found. The code does not directly execute SQL queries or use user-input data to construct SQL queries.
*   **Fix:** Not required.

#### 2. Command Injection Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** None found. The code does not use the `subprocess` module or execute system commands using user-input data.
*   **Fix:** Not required.

#### 3. Path Traversal Issues

*   **Vulnerability:** The `target_path` and `report_path` are resolved using the `Path.resolve()` method, which can potentially lead to path traversal issues if the input paths are not properly sanitized.
*   **Fix:** To prevent path traversal issues, ensure that the input paths are properly sanitized and validated. You can use the `Path.is_absolute()` method to check if the path is absolute and the `Path.name` attribute to get the path's filename.

```python
target_path = Path(args.path).resolve()
if not target_path.is_absolute():
    target_path = Path.cwd() / target_path

# ...

report_path = Path(args.output).resolve()
if not report_path.is_absolute():
    report_path = Path.cwd() / report_path
```

#### 4. Authentication and Authorization Flaws

*   **Vulnerability:** The code does not appear to implement any authentication or authorization mechanisms. This could be a concern if the application is intended to be used in a multi-user environment or exposes sensitive data.
*   **Fix:** Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as using a library like `authlib` or `Flask-Login`, to ensure that only authorized users can access the application's functionality.

#### 5. Improper Error Handling and Information Leakage

*   **Vulnerability:** The code catches and logs errors using the `logger.error()` function, but it does not provide detailed error messages or stack traces. This could potentially lead to information leakage if the application is exposed to an attacker.
*   **Fix:** Implement proper error handling mechanisms, such as using a library like `sentry` to capture and handle errors, and ensure that error messages and stack traces are not exposed to unauthorized users.

```python
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    logger.error("An error occurred: %s", e)
    # You can also use a library like sentry to capture and handle errors
    # import sentry_sdk
    # sentry_sdk.capture_exception()
```

#### 6. Hardcoded Secrets

*   **Vulnerability:** None found. The code does not appear to contain any hardcoded secrets.
*   **Fix:** Not required.

#### 7. Insecure Use of Cryptographic Functions

*   **Vulnerability:** None found. The code does not appear to use any cryptographic functions.
*   **Fix:** Not required.

### Additional Recommendations

*   **Input Validation:** Validate user-input data to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure Configuration:** Ensure that sensitive configuration data, such as database credentials, is stored securely and not exposed in the code or configuration files.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Perform regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.

### Updated Code

Here is an updated version of the code that addresses the identified security vulnerabilities and issues:

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

# Step-by-step analysis of the performance issues:

## 1. Inefficient Algorithms or Data Structures

The provided code seems to utilize a `CodeAnalyzer` class and a `ReportGenerator` class, which are not shown in the given code snippet. However, based on the usage, it appears that the `scan_codebase` method of `CodeAnalyzer` might be scanning the SQL files and analyzing them.

*   **Performance Problem:** If the `scan_codebase` method has a time complexity of O(n^2) or worse due to nested loops or inefficient data structures, it could lead to performance issues for large SQL files or directories.

*   **Optimization:** Consider optimizing the `scan_codebase` method by:
    *   Using more efficient data structures, such as dictionaries or sets, to store and look up data.
    *   Implementing a more efficient algorithm, such as using a single pass through the SQL files.

## 2. Repeated Computations that Could be Cached

The code loads a configuration file using the `load_config` function.

*   **Performance Problem:** If the `load_config` function is called multiple times with the same configuration file, it could lead to repeated computations and unnecessary resource usage.

*   **Optimization:** Consider caching the loaded configuration using a dictionary or a caching library like `functools.lru_cache`. This way, if the same configuration file is loaded again, the cached result can be returned instead of reloading the configuration.

## 3. Unnecessary Resource Usage

The code sets up logging using the `setup_logging` function.

*   **Performance Problem:** If the logging level is set too low (e.g., DEBUG), it could lead to excessive logging and unnecessary resource usage.

*   **Optimization:** Consider setting the logging level to a higher level (e.g., INFO or WARNING) in production environments to reduce unnecessary logging.

## 4. Database Query Inefficiencies

There are no explicit database queries in the provided code snippet. However, if the `CodeAnalyzer` class or other parts of the code interact with a database, inefficient database queries could be a performance issue.

*   **Performance Problem:** If database queries are not optimized, they could lead to slow performance and excessive resource usage.

*   **Optimization:** Consider optimizing database queries by:
    *   Using indexes on columns used in WHERE and JOIN clauses.
    *   Limiting the number of rows retrieved using LIMIT clauses.
    *   Avoiding SELECT \* and instead selecting only necessary columns.

## 5. Memory Leaks or Excessive Memory Usage

The code uses several classes and functions that could potentially lead to memory leaks or excessive memory usage if not implemented carefully.

*   **Performance Problem:** If the `CodeAnalyzer` or `ReportGenerator` classes store large amounts of data in memory without releasing it, it could lead to memory leaks or excessive memory usage.

*   **Optimization:** Consider implementing the `__del__` method or using context managers to ensure that resources are released when no longer needed. Additionally, consider using generators or iterators to process large datasets in chunks instead of loading them all into memory at once.

## 6. Threading or Concurrency Issues

The provided code snippet does not appear to use threading or concurrency. However, if the `CodeAnalyzer` class or other parts of the code use threading or concurrency, issues like deadlocks, race conditions, or synchronization overhead could occur.

*   **Performance Problem:** If threading or concurrency is not implemented correctly, it could lead to performance issues and slow down the application.

*   **Optimization:** Consider using high-level concurrency libraries like `concurrent.futures` or `asyncio` to simplify concurrency and avoid common pitfalls. Ensure that threads or concurrent tasks are properly synchronized and that resources are shared safely.

# Fixed solution:

The provided code snippet does not have obvious performance issues that can be fixed without seeing the implementation of `CodeAnalyzer` and `ReportGenerator` classes. However, here are some suggestions for improvement:

```python
import os
import sys
import json
import argparse
from pathlib import Path
from functools import lru_cache

from scanner.code_analyzer import CodeAnalyzer
from scanner.report_generator import ReportGenerator
from scanner.utils import setup_logging, load_config

    """Cache loaded configurations."""
    return load_config(config_path)

def parse_arguments():
    """Parse command line arguments."""
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description="Scan SQL queries for performance issues using Cerebras and Llama 4."
    )
    parser.add_argument(

    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--categories", 
        type=str,

        default=["SQL-specific Performance Tuning"],
        help="Specific SQL performance categories to scan for"
    )
    return parser.parse_args()

def main():
    """Main entry point for the SQL scanner application."""
    args = parse_arguments()
    
    # Load configuration with caching
    config = load_config_cached(args.config)
    
    # Initialize the code analyzer
    analyzer = CodeAnalyzer(config)
    
    # Scan the SQL file or directory
    target_path = Path(args.path).resolve()
    if not target_path.exists():
        logger.error(f"Path does not exist: {target_path}")
        sys.exit(1)
        
    logger.info(f"Scanning SQL at: {target_path}")
    
    # Scan the codebase
    results = analyzer.scan_codebase(target_path, categories=args.categories)
    
    # Generate report
    report_generator = ReportGenerator()
    report_path = Path(args.output).resolve()
    report_generator.generate_report(results, report_path)
    
    logger.info(f"Scan complete. Report saved to: {report_path}")
    
    # Print summary
    print(f"\nSQL Scan Summary:")
    print(f"  Files scanned: {results['stats']['files_scanned']}")
    print(f"  Issues found: {results['stats']['total_issues']}")
    print(f"  Report saved to: {report_path}")
    
    # Print categories breakdown if issues were found
    if results['stats']['total_issues'] > 0:
        print("\nIssues by category:")
        for category, count in results['stats']['categories'].items():
            print(f"  {category}: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

# Explanation of changes:

*   **Added caching for configuration loading**: Used the `@lru_cache` decorator to cache loaded configurations. This way, if the same configuration file is loaded again, the cached result can be returned instead of reloading the configuration.

# Tests and example uses:

To test the performance of the code, you can use tools like `timeit` or `cProfile` to measure the execution time and identify performance bottlenecks.

```python
import timeit

def test_scan_codebase():
    # Create a test CodeAnalyzer instance
    analyzer = CodeAnalyzer(load_config("config.json"))
    
    # Create a test target path
    target_path = Path("sample_code/inefficient_queries.sql").resolve()
    
    # Measure the execution time of scan_codebase
    start_time = timeit.default_timer()
    results = analyzer.scan_codebase(target_path, categories=["SQL-specific Performance Tuning"])
    end_time = timeit.default_timer()
    
    # Print the execution time
    print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

test_scan_codebase()
```

You can also use `cProfile` to profile the code and identify performance bottlenecks:

```python
import cProfile

def test_scan_codebase():
    # Create a test CodeAnalyzer instance
    analyzer = CodeAnalyzer(load_config("config.json"))
    
    # Create a test target path
    target_path = Path("sample_code/inefficient_queries.sql").resolve()
    
    # Profile the scan_codebase method
    profiler = cProfile.Profile()
    profiler.enable()
    results = analyzer.scan_codebase(target_path, categories=["SQL-specific Performance Tuning"])
    profiler.disable()
    
    # Print the profiling results
    profiler.print_stats(sort='cumulative')

test_scan_codebase()
```

These tests can help identify performance bottlenecks and guide optimizations.

SECURITY ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

Analysis Report
================

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** The `get_user` function is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The `username` parameter is directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization.
*   **Fix:** Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Modify the `get_user` function as follows:

    ```python
@app.route('/user/<username>')
def get_user(username):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('users.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Use parameterized query to prevent SQL injection
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"
    cursor.execute(query, (username,))
    
    user = cursor.fetchone()
    conn.close()
    
    return str(user)
```

### 2. Command Injection Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** The `ping` function is vulnerable to command injection attacks. The `hostname` parameter is directly used in the `os.system` call without proper sanitization.
*   **Fix:** Use a safer alternative to `os.system`, such as `subprocess.run`, and validate the input. Modify the `ping` function as follows:

    ```python
import subprocess

@app.route('/ping')
def ping():
    hostname = request.args.get('host', 'localhost')
    
    # Validate input and use subprocess.run
    if not hostname:
        return "Hostname is required"
    
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(["ping", "-c", "1", hostname], capture_output=True, text=True)
        return f"Ping result: {result.stdout}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"
```

### 3. Path Traversal Issues

*   **Vulnerability:** The `download_file` function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The `filename` parameter is directly used to open a file without proper validation.
*   **Fix:** Validate the input and use a safe way to construct the file path. Modify the `download_file` function as follows:

    ```python
import os

@app.route('/download')
def download_file():
    filename = request.args.get('filename')
    
    # Validate input and construct a safe file path
    if not filename:
        return "Filename is required"
    
    base_dir = '/path/to/safe/directory'
    safe_path = os.path.join(base_dir, filename)
    
    if not os.path.abspath(safe_path).startswith(base_dir):
        return "Invalid filename"
    
    try:
        with open(safe_path, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
        return content
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"
```

### 4. Authentication and Authorization Flaws

*   **Vulnerability:** The application lacks proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **Fix:** Implement authentication and authorization using a library like Flask-Login or Flask-Security. Ensure that sensitive routes and data are protected.

### 5. Improper Error Handling and Information Leakage

*   **Vulnerability:** The application does not handle errors properly, and sensitive information is leaked in error messages.
*   **Fix:** Implement proper error handling using try-except blocks, and log errors instead of displaying them to users. Modify the `divide` function as follows:

    ```python
@app.route('/divide')
def divide():
    try:
        a = int(request.args.get('a', '0'))
        b = int(request.args.get('b', '0'))
        
        if b == 0:
            return "Error: Division by zero", 400
        
        result = a / b
        return f"{a} / {b} = {result}"
    except Exception as e:
        # Log the error and return a generic error message
        print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
        return "Internal Server Error", 500
```

### 6. Hardcoded Secrets

*   **Vulnerability:** The application has hardcoded secrets, including database credentials and an API key.
*   **Fix:** Store sensitive data in environment variables or a secure secrets management system. Modify the code as follows:

    ```python
import os

DB_USER = os.environ.get('DB_USER')
DB_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('DB_PASSWORD')
API_KEY = os.environ.get('API_KEY')
```

### 7. Insecure Use of Cryptographic Functions

*   **Vulnerability:** The application uses weak cryptography (MD5) for password hashing.
*   **Fix:** Use a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2. Modify the `register` function as follows:

    ```python
import bcrypt

@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def register():
    username = request.form.get('username')
    password = request.form.get('password')
    
    # Use bcrypt for password hashing
    password_hash = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt())
    
    # Store user in database (simplified)
    return f"User {username} registered with hash {password_hash}"
```

Additional Recommendations
-------------------------

*   Avoid using `pickle` for deserialization, as it can lead to security vulnerabilities. Instead, use a safer serialization format like JSON.
*   Use a secure random number generator like `secrets` for generating tokens and random numbers.
*   Avoid running the application in debug mode in production environments.
*   Implement security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to protect against web attacks.

--------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:
The given Python code has several performance issues that need to be addressed.

### 1. Inefficient algorithms or data structures

*   **Inefficient O(n²) algorithm in `find_duplicates` function**: The current implementation has a time complexity of O(n²) due to the nested loops. This can be optimized using a set data structure to keep track of unique items and duplicates.

### 2. Repeated computations that could be cached

*   **No caching mechanisms**: The code does not utilize caching, which can significantly improve performance by avoiding repeated computations.

### 3. Unnecessary resource usage

*   **Database connections not reused**: In the `/user/<username>` route, a new database connection is established for each request. This can be optimized by reusing database connections.

### 4. Database query inefficiencies

*   **SQL injection vulnerability in `/user/<username>` route**: The SQL query is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This can be fixed by using parameterized queries.

### 5. Memory leaks or excessive memory usage

*   **No memory management**: The code does not have explicit memory management, which can lead to memory leaks.

### 6. Threading or concurrency issues

*   **No concurrency control**: The code does not have concurrency control mechanisms, which can lead to data corruption or other concurrency-related issues.

## Performance Optimization Suggestions:

### 1. Inefficient algorithms or data structures

*   **Optimize `find_duplicates` function**: Use a set to store unique items and duplicates. This reduces the time complexity to O(n).

```python
def find_duplicates(items):
    seen = set()
    duplicates = set()
    
    for item in items:
        if item in seen:
            duplicates.add(item)
        seen.add(item)
    
    return list(duplicates)
```

### 2. Repeated computations that could be cached

*   **Implement caching**: Use a caching library like Flask-Caching to cache frequently accessed data.

```python
from flask_caching import Cache

app = Flask(__name__)
cache = Cache(app, config={'CACHE_TYPE': 'SimpleCache'})

@app.route('/user/<username>')
@cache.cached(timeout=60, query_string=True)
def get_user(username):
    # ...
```

### 3. Unnecessary resource usage

*   **Reuse database connections**: Use a connection pool to reuse database connections.

```python
import sqlite3
from sqlite3 import pool

# Create a connection pool
conn_pool = pool.ThreadedConnectionPool(
    1,  # Minimum number of connections
    10,  # Maximum number of connections
    'users.db',
    user=DB_USER,
    password=DB_PASSWORD
)

@app.route('/user/<username>')
def get_user(username):
    conn = conn_pool.getconn()
    try:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"
        cursor.execute(query, (username,))
        user = cursor.fetchone()
        return str(user)
    finally:
        conn_pool.putconn(conn)
```

### 4. Database query inefficiencies

*   **Fix SQL injection vulnerability**: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

```python
@app.route('/user/<username>')
def get_user(username):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('users.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"
    cursor.execute(query, (username,))
    
    user = cursor.fetchone()
    conn.close()
    
    return str(user)
```

### 5. Memory leaks or excessive memory usage

*   **Implement memory management**: Use weak references to avoid circular references and enable garbage collection.

```python
import weakref

class User:
    def __init__(self, username):
        self.username = username

# Create a weak reference to the User object
user_ref = weakref.ref(User("example_user"))
```

### 6. Threading or concurrency issues

*   **Implement concurrency control**: Use locks or semaphores to control concurrent access to shared resources.

```python
import threading

lock = threading.Lock()

@app.route('/user/<username>')
def get_user(username):
    with lock:
        # Critical section
        conn = sqlite3.connect('users.db')
        # ...
```

## Additional suggestions:

*   **Use secure password hashing**: Replace MD5 with a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.

```python
import bcrypt

@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def register():
    username = request.form.get('username')
    password = request.form.get('password')
    
    # Secure password hashing using bcrypt
    password_hash = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt())
    
    # Store user in database (simplified)
    return f"User {username} registered with hash {password_hash}"
```

*   **Use secure random number generation**: Replace `random` with a secure random number generator like `secrets`.

```python
import secrets

@app.route('/reset_password')
def reset_password():
    username = request.args.get('username')
    
    # Secure random token generation using secrets
    token = secrets.token_urlsafe(16)
    
    return f"Password reset token for {username}: {token}"
```

libraries = {
    "Cerebras": "cerebras.cloud.sdk",
    "GPTIndex": "gpt_index",
    "LlamaIndex": "llama_index",
    "YAML": "yaml",
    "typing_extensions": "typing_extensions",
}

# Initialize logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def import_libraries():
    for name, module_name in libraries.items():
        try:
            __import__(module_name)
            logging.info(f"{name} imported successfully")
        except ImportError:
            logging.error(f"Failed to import {name}")
        except AttributeError:

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

**Performance Analysis Report**

### Overview

The provided code snippet focuses on importing various Python modules and packages, including Cerebras SDK, GPTIndex, LlamaIndex, YAML, and typing_extensions. The code does not contain any significant computational tasks or database queries. However, there are a few potential performance issues and improvements that can be suggested.

### Issues and Optimizations

#### 1. Inefficient Algorithms or Data Structures

*   **Issue:** The code does not appear to use any inefficient algorithms or data structures.
*   **Optimization:** No optimization is required in this regard.

#### 2. Repeated Computations that Could be Cached

*   **Issue:** The code does not perform any repeated computations that could be cached.
*   **Optimization:** No optimization is required in this regard.

#### 3. Unnecessary Resource Usage

*   **Issue:** The code attempts to import multiple modules and handles `ImportError` and `AttributeError` exceptions separately. While this is not necessarily an issue, it can be optimized.
*   **Optimization:** Instead of having separate `try-except` blocks for each import statement, consider grouping them into a single `try-except` block. This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to manage.

```python
try:
    from cerebras.cloud.sdk import Cerebras
    from gpt_index import GPTIndex
    from llama_index import LlamaIndex
    import yaml
    import typing_extensions
    print("All imports successful")
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Failed to import modules: {e}")
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Attribute error: {e}")
```

#### 4. Database Query Inefficiencies

*   **Issue:** The code does not contain any database queries.
*   **Optimization:** No optimization is required in this regard.

#### 5. Memory Leaks or Excessive Memory Usage

*   **Issue:** The code does not appear to have any memory leaks or excessive memory usage.
*   **Optimization:** To ensure memory safety, consider using a tool like `memory_profiler` or `psutil` to monitor memory usage.

#### 6. Threading or Concurrency Issues

*   **Issue:** The code does not appear to have any threading or concurrency issues.
*   **Optimization:** No optimization is required in this regard.

### Additional Suggestions

*   **Import Order:** The code imports modules in a specific order. Consider following the standard Python import order:
    1.  Standard library imports
    2.  Related third-party imports
    3.  Local application imports

```python
import sys
import yaml
import typing_extensions

try:
    from cerebras.cloud.sdk import Cerebras
    from gpt_index import GPTIndex
    from llama_index import LlamaIndex
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Failed to import modules: {e}")
```

*   **Module Version Checking:** The code checks the version of `typing_extensions` but does not handle potential version-specific issues. Consider adding version checks for other modules if necessary.

```python
try:
    import typing_extensions
    print(f"typing_extensions imported successfully, version: {typing_extensions.__version__}")
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Failed to import typing_extensions: {e}")
except AttributeError:
    print("typing_extensions imported but version not available")
```

### Refactored Code

Here's the refactored code incorporating the suggested optimizations:

```python
import sys
import yaml
import typing_extensions

def import_modules():
    try:
        from cerebras.cloud.sdk import Cerebras
        from gpt_index import GPTIndex
        from llama_index import LlamaIndex
        print("All imports successful")
    except ImportError as e:
        print(f"Failed to import modules: {e}")
    except AttributeError as e:
        print(f"Attribute error: {e}")

    try:
        print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
        print(f"typing_extensions imported successfully, version: {typing_extensions.__version__}")
    except ImportError as e:
        print(f"Failed to import typing_extensions: {e}")
    except AttributeError:
        print("typing_extensions imported but version not available")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import_modules()
```

This refactored code reduces code duplication, follows standard Python import order, and separates concerns into a single function.

SECURITY ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

### Security Analysis Report

The provided code snippet appears to be a simple Python script utilizing the Cerebras Cloud SDK for interacting with a chat completion API. Despite its simplicity, several potential security concerns and best practices are identified below.

#### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** Not applicable in this context, as the code does not interact with a database or execute SQL queries.
*   **Fix:** N/A

#### 2. Command Injection Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** Not directly applicable here, as there are no system calls or execution of external commands using user-input data. However, if the `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` environment variable or any future additions to the code are constructed using user-input, it could potentially lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Fix:** Ensure that any user-input is properly sanitized and validated before using it in constructing environment variables or command executions.

#### 3. Path Traversal Issues

*   **Vulnerability:** Not applicable, as there is no file system interaction that could lead to path traversal issues.
*   **Fix:** N/A

#### 4. Authentication and Authorization Flaws

*   **Vulnerability:** The code uses an API key stored in an environment variable (`CEREBRAS_API_KEY`). While this approach is good for hiding the key, the code does not validate or check the permissions associated with this key.
*   **Fix:** Implement checks to ensure that the API key has the necessary permissions for the operations being performed. Additionally, consider implementing retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for authentication failures.

#### 5. Improper Error Handling and Information Leakage

*   **Vulnerability:** The code does not handle potential exceptions that might be raised during the API call (e.g., network errors, API rate limits, authentication errors).
*   **Fix:** Implement proper error handling to catch exceptions, provide meaningful error messages, and avoid leaking sensitive information.

```python
try:
    chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Why is fast inference important?",
            }
        ],
        model="llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct",
    )
except Exception as e:
    # Log the error and provide a generic error message
    print("An error occurred. Please try again later.")
```

#### 6. Hardcoded Secrets

*   **Vulnerability:** While not hardcoded directly in the script, the `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` is retrieved from an environment variable. This is a good practice. However, ensure that the environment variable is not accidentally committed to version control or exposed through logs.
*   **Fix:** Continue to use environment variables or a secure secrets management system for sensitive data. Implement a `.gitignore` rule to prevent `.env` files or similar from being committed.

#### 7. Insecure Use of Cryptographic Functions

*   **Vulnerability:** Not applicable, as there is no direct use of cryptographic functions in the provided code snippet.
*   **Fix:** N/A

### Additional Recommendations

- **Logging:** Implement logging to monitor the application's behavior and errors without exposing sensitive information.
- **Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies (e.g., `cerebras.cloud.sdk`) to ensure you have the latest security patches.

### Updated Code Example with Error Handling

```python
import os
import logging
from cerebras.cloud.sdk import Cerebras

# Basic logging configuration
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def main():
    try:
        client = Cerebras(
            api_key=os.environ.get("CEREBRAS_API_KEY"),
        )

        chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": "Why is fast inference important?",
                }
            ],
            model="llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct",
        )

        print(chat_completion)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        print("An error occurred. Please try again later.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

--------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

### Performance Analysis

The provided code snippet appears to be a simple API call to the Cerebras cloud SDK for chat completion. However, there are a few potential performance issues that can be identified:

#### 1. Inefficient Algorithms or Data Structures

*   **Issue:** The code does not seem to use any inefficient algorithms or data structures. It simply creates a chat completion using the Cerebras API.
*   **Optimization:** No optimization is needed in this regard.

#### 2. Repeated Computations that Could be Cached

*   **Issue:** The code does not perform any repeated computations that could be cached. Each API call is a new request.
*   **Optimization:** If the same `chat_completion` request is made multiple times with the same input, consider caching the results to avoid redundant API calls.

#### 3. Unnecessary Resource Usage

*   **Issue:** The code does not appear to use any unnecessary resources. It only makes a single API call.
*   **Optimization:** No optimization is needed in this regard.

#### 4. Database Query Inefficiencies

*   **Issue:** The code does not seem to interact with a database, so there are no database query inefficiencies.
*   **Optimization:** Not applicable.

#### 5. Memory Leaks or Excessive Memory Usage

*   **Issue:** The code does not seem to handle large amounts of data or have any obvious memory leaks.
*   **Optimization:** To prevent potential memory issues with large API responses, consider using a streaming approach to handle the response, if supported by the Cerebras API.

#### 6. Threading or Concurrency Issues

*   **Issue:** The code does not appear to use threading or concurrency, which could lead to performance bottlenecks if making multiple API calls sequentially.
*   **Optimization:** If making multiple API calls, consider using concurrent.futures or asyncio to make parallel requests, improving overall throughput.

### Suggested Optimizations

Based on the analysis, here are some suggested optimizations:

*   **Caching:** Implement caching for repeated `chat_completion` requests with the same input to avoid redundant API calls.
*   **Concurrency:** Use concurrent.futures or asyncio to make parallel API calls, if applicable.
*   **Streaming Response:** If the Cerebras API supports streaming responses, consider using a streaming approach to handle large responses and prevent memory issues.

### Example Code with Caching and Concurrency

Here's an example of how you could implement caching and concurrency using the `functools` and `concurrent.futures` modules:

```python
import os
import functools
from cerebras.cloud.sdk import Cerebras
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

client = Cerebras(
    api_key=os.environ.get("CEREBRAS_API_KEY"),
)

# Cache results for repeated requests
@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def get_chat_completion(messages, model):
    return client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=messages,
        model=model,
    )

def main():
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Why is fast inference important?",
        }
    ]
    model = "llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct"

    # Make multiple API calls concurrently
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(get_chat_completion, messages, model) for _ in range(10)]
        results = [future.result() for future in futures]

    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, the `get_chat_completion` function is cached using `functools.lru_cache` to avoid redundant API calls with the same input. The `main` function demonstrates how to make multiple API calls concurrently using `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

SECURITY ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

**Security Analysis Report**
================================

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

* **Vulnerability:** Not found. The provided code does not interact with a database, so SQL injection is not a concern.
* **Fix:** N/A

### 2. Command Injection Vulnerabilities

* **Vulnerability:** Not found. The code does not execute any system commands, so command injection is not a concern.
* **Fix:** N/A

### 3. Path Traversal Issues

* **Vulnerability:** Not found. The code does not interact with the file system in a way that could lead to path traversal issues.
* **Fix:** N/A

### 4. Authentication and Authorization Flaws

* **Vulnerability:** The code uses an API key stored in an environment variable (`CEREBRAS_API_KEY`). However, it does not validate or verify the API key's authenticity.
* **Fix:** While the code seems to be using a secure method to store the API key, it's essential to ensure that the key is properly validated and verified on the Cerebras platform. Consider implementing additional authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as role-based access control.

### 5. Improper Error Handling and Information Leakage

* **Vulnerability:** The code does not handle errors explicitly. If an error occurs during the `chat.completions.create` method, it may leak sensitive information.
* **Fix:** Implement try-except blocks to handle potential errors and exceptions. Log errors securely, and avoid exposing sensitive information.

```python
try:
    chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        # ...
    )
except Exception as e:
    # Log the error securely
    print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
```

### 6. Hardcoded Secrets

* **Vulnerability:** The API key is stored in an environment variable (`CEREBRAS_API_KEY`), which is a good practice. However, ensure that the environment variable is not hardcoded or exposed in the code.
* **Fix:** The code seems to be using a secure method to store the API key. Make sure to keep the environment variable secure and not expose it in the code.

### 7. Insecure Use of Cryptographic Functions

* **Vulnerability:** Not found. The code does not use cryptographic functions.
* **Fix:** N/A

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Regularly update the `cerebras` library to ensure you have the latest security patches.
* Implement secure logging mechanisms to handle errors and exceptions.
* Consider implementing additional security measures, such as rate limiting and IP blocking, to prevent abuse.

**Updated Code:**
```python
import os
import logging
from cerebras.cloud.sdk import Cerebras

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

client = Cerebras(
    api_key=os.environ.get("CEREBRAS_API_KEY"),
)

try:
    chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Why is fast inference important?",
            }
        ],
        model="llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct",
    )
    print(chat_completion)
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
```

--------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

### Performance Analysis and Optimization Suggestions

The provided code snippet appears to be a simple API call to the Cerebras cloud SDK for chat completion. However, there are a few potential performance issues and areas for optimization:

#### 1. Inefficient Algorithms or Data Structures

*   **Issue:** The code uses a list to store a single message, which is not inherently inefficient but could be improved for readability and flexibility.
*   **Optimization:** Consider using a more robust data structure like a dictionary or an object to represent the message, especially if the code needs to be extended to handle multiple messages or more complex message structures.

#### 2. Repeated Computations that Could be Cached

*   **Issue:** The API key is retrieved from the environment variable on every run, which is not a performance bottleneck but could be optimized for better security and reliability.
*   **Optimization:** Cache the API key or load it once during application initialization to reduce the overhead of environment variable access and improve security by minimizing exposure.

#### 3. Unnecessary Resource Usage

*   **Issue:** The code does not handle any exceptions that might occur during the API call, which could lead to resource leaks or unnecessary retries.
*   **Optimization:** Implement proper error handling and exception handling mechanisms to ensure that resources are released and retries are handled efficiently.

#### 4. Database Query Inefficiencies

*   **Issue:** There are no database queries in the provided code snippet, so there are no database query inefficiencies to report.
*   **Optimization:** N/A

#### 5. Memory Leaks or Excessive Memory Usage

*   **Issue:** The code stores the entire chat completion response in memory, which could be a concern if the response is large or if the code is handling multiple requests concurrently.
*   **Optimization:** Consider using a streaming approach to handle large responses or implement a mechanism to process the response in chunks to reduce memory usage.

#### 6. Threading or Concurrency Issues

*   **Issue:** The code appears to be synchronous and does not handle concurrency, which could limit its performance in high-throughput scenarios.
*   **Optimization:** Consider using asynchronous programming or concurrent execution mechanisms (e.g., threads, processes, or async/await) to improve the code's performance and responsiveness.

### Optimized Code Example

Here's an example of how the code could be optimized:

```python
import os
from cerebras.cloud.sdk import Cerebras
import logging

# Initialize the logger
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class CerebrasClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key=None):
        self.api_key = api_key or os.environ.get("CEREBRAS_API_KEY")
        self.client = Cerebras(api_key=self.api_key)

    def get_chat_completion(self, messages, model):
        try:
            chat_completion = self.client.chat.completions.create(
                messages=messages,
                model=model,
            )
            return chat_completion
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error getting chat completion: {e}")
            return None

def main():
    client = CerebrasClient()
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Why is fast inference important?",
        }
    ]
    model = "llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct"
    chat_completion = client.get_chat_completion(messages, model)
    if chat_completion:
        print(chat_completion)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this optimized version:

*   The API key is loaded once during class initialization.
*   Error handling is implemented to catch and log any exceptions that might occur during the API call.
*   The code is organized into a class with a clear separation of concerns.
*   The `main` function demonstrates a simple usage example.

Note that this is just one possible way to optimize the code, and further improvements might be necessary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.

SECURITY ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

Analysis of the Provided Code
================================

The provided code appears to be a part of a larger system, specifically designed to manage prompt templates for different vulnerability categories. The code is well-structured, readable, and uses best practices. However, there are a few potential security vulnerabilities and areas for improvement:

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** None found. The code does not interact with a database directly, so SQL injection is not a concern.
*   **Fix:** N/A

### 2. Command Injection Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** None found. The code does not execute any system commands, so command injection is not a concern.
*   **Fix:** N/A

### 3. Path Traversal Issues

*   **Vulnerability:** Potential path traversal issue when loading prompts from a file.
    *   The `prompts_file` parameter in the `__init__` method is not validated or sanitized. If an attacker can control this parameter, they might be able to load prompts from an arbitrary file.
*   **Fix:** Validate and sanitize the `prompts_file` parameter to ensure it points to a file within a specific directory.

```python
import os

def __init__(self, prompts_file: str):
    """Initialize the PromptManager.
    
    Args:
        prompts_file: Path to the JSON file containing prompt templates.
    """
    base_dir = "/path/to/prompts"  # Define a base directory for prompts
    prompts_file = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(base_dir, prompts_file))
    
    # Check if the file is within the base directory
    if not prompts_file.startswith(base_dir):
        raise ValueError("Invalid prompts file path")
    
    self.prompts_file = prompts_file
    self.prompts = self._load_prompts()
```

### 4. Authentication and Authorization Flaws

*   **Vulnerability:** None found. The code does not handle authentication or authorization.
*   **Fix:** N/A

### 5. Improper Error Handling and Information Leakage

*   **Vulnerability:** Potential information leakage when loading prompts from a file.
    *   The `_load_prompts` method catches all exceptions and logs a generic error message. This might reveal sensitive information about the system or the file being loaded.
*   **Fix:** Improve error handling to provide more specific error messages and avoid revealing sensitive information.

```python
def _load_prompts(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Load prompt templates from the JSON file.
    
    Returns:
        A list of prompt template dictionaries.
    """
    try:
        with open(self.prompts_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            prompts = json.load(f)
        return prompts
    except FileNotFoundError:

    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        logger.error(f"Error parsing prompts file: {str(e)}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Unexpected error loading prompts: {str(e)}")
    return []
```

### 6. Hardcoded Secrets

*   **Vulnerability:** None found. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets.
*   **Fix:** N/A

### 7. Insecure Use of Cryptographic Functions

*   **Vulnerability:** None found. The code does not use any cryptographic functions.
*   **Fix:** N/A

Additional Recommendations
-------------------------

*   Consider adding input validation for the `language`, `category`, and `subcategory` parameters in the `get_prompts`, `get_prompt_by_category`, `get_categories`, and `get_subcategories` methods.
*   Use a more specific exception type instead of the general `Exception` class.
*   Consider implementing logging rotation and retention policies to prevent log file growth.

By addressing these potential security vulnerabilities and following best practices, you can improve the security and reliability of your code.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:
1. **Inefficient algorithm for grouping prompts by language**: The current implementation uses a dictionary to group prompts by language, which has a time complexity of O(n). However, it iterates over the entire list of prompts to group them, which can be inefficient if the list of prompts is large. This can be optimized by grouping prompts by language while loading them from the JSON file.
2. **Repeated computations that could be cached**: The `get_categories` and `get_subcategories` methods iterate over the list of prompts for a language to get categories and subcategories. These computations can be cached to avoid repeated iterations.
3. **Inefficient search in `get_prompt_by_category` method**: The `get_prompt_by_category` method iterates over the entire list of prompts to find a specific prompt by category and subcategory. This can be optimized by using a dictionary to store prompts with their category and subcategory as keys.
4. **Unnecessary resource usage**: The `get_prompts` method returns a list of prompt dictionaries, which can be large if the number of prompts is large. This can be optimized by using a generator instead of a list.
5. **Memory leaks or excessive memory usage**: The `prompts` list and `prompts_by_language` dictionary can consume a large amount of memory if the number of prompts is large. This can be optimized by using a more memory-efficient data structure, such as a database.
6. **Threading or concurrency issues**: The `PromptManager` class is not thread-safe. If multiple threads access the `prompts` list or `prompts_by_language` dictionary simultaneously, it can lead to data corruption or other concurrency issues.

# Explanation of changes:
*   **Grouped prompts by language while loading**: Instead of iterating over the entire list of prompts to group them by language, we group them while loading from the JSON file.
*   **Cached categories and subcategories**: We use dictionaries to cache categories and subcategories for each language, which avoids repeated iterations over the list of prompts.
*   **Optimized search in `get_prompt_by_category` method**: We use a dictionary to store prompts with their category and subcategory as keys, which allows for faster lookup.
*   **Used generator instead of list**: We return a list of prompt dictionaries, but we can optimize this by using a generator instead.
*   **Used more memory-efficient data structures**: We use dictionaries and sets to store prompts, categories, and subcategories, which are more memory-efficient than lists.

# Tests and example uses:
```python
# Create a PromptManager instance
prompt_manager = PromptManager("prompts.json")

# Get prompts for a language
prompts = prompt_manager.get_prompts("python")
print(prompts)

# Get prompts for a language and categories
prompts = prompt_manager.get_prompts("python", ["category1", "category2"])
print(prompts)

# Get a prompt by category and subcategory
prompt = prompt_manager.get_prompt_by_category("python", "category1", "subcategory1")
print(prompt)

# Get categories for a language
categories = prompt_manager.get_categories("python")
print(categories)

# Get subcategories for a language and category
subcategories = prompt_manager.get_subcategories("python", "category1")
print(subcategories)

```
Note that this analysis is limited to the provided code snippet. A more comprehensive security analysis would require access to the entire codebase.

--------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

**Performance Analysis and Optimization Suggestions**

The provided code snippet appears to be a module header for a Python package, specifically the Cerebras Code Scanner. Given the limited scope of the code, the analysis will focus on potential issues that could arise in the context of the entire project.

### 1. Inefficient Algorithms or Data Structures

*   **Issue:** None apparent in the provided code snippet.
*   **Optimization:** N/A

However, in a typical scanning module, algorithms and data structures can significantly impact performance. For instance:

*   Using a `set` for storing unique identifiers or configurations can provide faster lookups (O(1)) compared to lists (O(n)).
*   Implementing efficient algorithms for parsing and analyzing Python code, such as using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser, can reduce computational complexity.

### 2. Repeated Computations that Could be Cached

*   **Issue:** None apparent in the provided code snippet.
*   **Optimization:** Consider using a caching mechanism (e.g., `functools.lru_cache`) for expensive computations that are repeated throughout the scanning process.

Example:
```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def compute_expensive_result(input_data):
    # Simulate an expensive computation
    # ...
    return result
```

### 3. Unnecessary Resource Usage

*   **Issue:** None apparent in the provided code snippet.
*   **Optimization:** Ensure that resources, such as file handles or network connections, are properly closed after use to prevent resource leaks.

Example:
```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    # Use the file handle
    pass
# The file handle is automatically closed
```

### 4. Database Query Inefficiencies

*   **Issue:** None apparent in the provided code snippet.
*   **Optimization:** If the scanning module interacts with a database, consider using efficient query techniques, such as:
    *   Using indexes on frequently queried columns.
    *   Implementing batch queries or caching query results.
    *   Avoiding unnecessary database queries.

Example (using SQLAlchemy):
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///example.db")
Base = declarative_base()

class ExampleModel(Base):
    __tablename__ = "example"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)

Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Efficient query using indexing
result = session.query(ExampleModel).filter_by(name="example").all()
```

### 5. Memory Leaks or Excessive Memory Usage

*   **Issue:** None apparent in the provided code snippet.
*   **Optimization:** Ensure that large data structures are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks. Consider using:
    *   Weak references (`weakref` module) for objects that can be garbage collected.
    *   Generators or iterators for processing large datasets.

Example:
```python
import weakref

class LargeDataStructure:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = [i for i in range(1000000)]

    def __del__(self):
        print("Large data structure deleted")

large_data = LargeDataStructure()
weak_ref = weakref.ref(large_data)

# Use the weak reference
del large_data
```

### 6. Threading or Concurrency Issues

*   **Issue:** None apparent in the provided code snippet.
*   **Optimization:** If the scanning module uses threading or concurrency, consider:
    *   Using thread-safe data structures and synchronization primitives (e.g., locks, semaphores).
    *   Implementing efficient concurrency models, such as using `asyncio` for asynchronous I/O-bound operations.

Example (using `asyncio`):
```python
import asyncio

async def scan_code(code):
    # Simulate scanning code
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return result

async def main():
    tasks = [scan_code(code) for code in codes]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Recommendations**

*   Review the entire project codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks and apply optimizations as needed.
*   Use profiling tools (e.g., `cProfile`, `line_profiler`) to identify performance-critical sections of code.
*   Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track performance metrics and detect potential issues.

SECURITY ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

## Security Vulnerability Analysis
The code provided appears to be a utility module for a code scanner application. After reviewing the code, the following security vulnerabilities and issues have been identified:

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
No direct SQL injection vulnerabilities were found in the code. However, the `get_file_language` function checks if a file has a `.sql` extension. If this information is used elsewhere in the application to construct SQL queries, it could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Fix:** Ensure that any SQL queries constructed using user-provided or file-based information are properly sanitized and parameterized.

### 2. Command Injection Vulnerabilities
No command injection vulnerabilities were found in the code. However, the use of `os.environ.get("CEREBRAS_API_KEY", "")` could potentially be used to inject environment variables. 

**Fix:** Consider using a secure method to handle environment variables, such as using a secrets manager.

### 3. Path Traversal Issues
The `load_config` function uses the `Path` class to handle file paths. However, the `config_path` parameter is not validated or sanitized.

**Fix:** Validate and sanitize the `config_path` parameter to prevent path traversal attacks.

```python
def load_config(config_path: Union[str, Path] = "config.json") -> Dict[str, Any]:
    config_path = Path(config_path)
    if not config_path.is_absolute() and not config_path.is_relative_to("."):
        raise ValueError("Invalid config path")
    # ...
```

### 4. Authentication and Authorization Flaws
The code does not appear to have any authentication or authorization mechanisms implemented. The `cerebras_api_key` is loaded from an environment variable or a configuration file.

**Fix:** Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data and functionality.

### 5. Improper Error Handling and Information Leakage
The `load_config` function logs error messages when loading the configuration file. However, it does not handle errors properly, and sensitive information could potentially be leaked.

**Fix:** Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms to prevent information leakage.

```python
def load_config(config_path: Union[str, Path] = "config.json") -> Dict[str, Any]:
    try:
        # ...
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error("Error loading config")
        # Do not log sensitive information
        raise
```

### 6. Hardcoded Secrets
The code has a hardcoded default configuration, including a `cerebras_api_key` which is an empty string.

**Fix:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive information. Instead, use environment variables or a secrets manager.

```python
def load_config(config_path: Union[str, Path] = "config.json") -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # ...
    return {
        "cerebras_api_key": os.environ.get("CEREBRAS_API_KEY"),
        # ...
    }
```

### 7. Insecure Use of Cryptographic Functions
No cryptographic functions are used in the provided code.

## Additional Recommendations

* Consider using a secure logging mechanism, such as a logging framework that supports encryption and access controls.
* Validate and sanitize all user-provided input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
* Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms to prevent information leakage.
* Use a secrets manager to handle sensitive information, such as API keys and configuration data.

--------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

# Performance Analysis and Optimization

## 1. Inefficient Algorithms or Data Structures

### Issue: Simple Chunking Implementation

The `chunk_code` function uses a simple implementation that splits code by lines, assuming an average of 5 characters per token. This can lead to inaccurate chunking and inefficient processing.

**Optimization:** Consider using a more sophisticated tokenization approach, such as the `tokenizer` library, to accurately count tokens and split code into chunks.

### Solution:
```python
import re
import tokenize
import io

def chunk_code(code: str, max_tokens: int = 4000) -> List[str]:
    """Split code into manageable chunks for processing."""
    # Tokenize the code
    tokens = list(tokenize.generate_tokens(io.StringIO(code).readline))
    
    # Initialize chunks and current chunk size
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []
    current_size = 0
    
    for token in tokens:
        # If adding this token would exceed the limit, start a new chunk
        if current_size + 1 > max_tokens and current_chunk:
            chunks.append("".join(current_chunk))
            current_chunk = []
            current_size = 0
        
        # Add the token to the current chunk
        current_chunk.append(token[1])
        current_size += 1
    
    # Add the last chunk if it's not empty
    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append("".join(current_chunk))
    
    return chunks
```

## 2. Repeated Computations that Could be Cached

### Issue: Config Loading

The `load_config` function loads the configuration from a JSON file every time it's called. If the configuration doesn't change frequently, this can lead to repeated computations.

**Optimization:** Cache the loaded configuration using a decorator or a caching library.

### Solution:
```python
import functools

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)
def load_config(config_path: Union[str, Path] = "config.json") -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Load configuration from a JSON file."""
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

## 3. Unnecessary Resource Usage

### Issue: Logging Configuration

The `setup_logging` function creates a new logger instance every time it's called. If the logging configuration doesn't change, this can lead to unnecessary resource usage.

**Optimization:** Create the logger instance only once and reuse it.

### Solution:
```python
import logging

_logger = None

def setup_logging(log_level: str = "INFO") -> logging.Logger:
    """Set up logging configuration."""
    global _logger
    
    if _logger is None:
        # Create logs directory if it doesn't exist
        logs_dir = Path("logs")
        logs_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
        
        # Configure logging
        log_format = "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
        logging.basicConfig(
            level=getattr(logging, log_level),
            format=log_format,
            handlers=[
                logging.FileHandler(logs_dir / "scanner.log"),
                logging.StreamHandler()
            ]
        )
        
        _logger = logging.getLogger("cerebras_scanner")
    
    return _logger
```

## 4. Database Query Inefficiencies

There are no database queries in the provided code.

## 5. Memory Leaks or Excessive Memory Usage

### Issue: Large Configuration Files

The `load_config` function loads the entire configuration file into memory. If the configuration file is very large, this can lead to excessive memory usage.

**Optimization:** Consider using a streaming JSON parser to load large configuration files.

### Solution:
```python
import json

def load_config(config_path: Union[str, Path] = "config.json") -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Load configuration from a JSON file."""
    config_path = Path(config_path)
    
    # Use default config if file doesn't exist
    if not config_path.exists():
        # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
    
    try:
        with open(config_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            config = json.JSONDecoder().parse(f.read())
        return config
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error loading config from {config_path}: {str(e)}")
        raise
```

## 6. Threading or Concurrency Issues

There are no threading or concurrency issues in the provided code.

In summary, the provided code has some performance issues related to inefficient algorithms, repeated computations, and unnecessary resource usage. The suggested optimizations aim to address these issues and improve the overall performance of the code.

SECURITY ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

# Security Analysis Report

## Introduction
The provided code is a Python module for generating reports of scan results in Markdown and JSON formats. The analysis focuses on identifying potential security vulnerabilities in the code.

## Security Vulnerabilities and Fixes

### 1. Path Traversal Issues

*   **Vulnerability:** The `output_path` parameter in the `generate_report` method is not validated or sanitized, making it vulnerable to path traversal attacks.
*   **Fix:** Validate and sanitize the `output_path` to ensure it's within a designated output directory. Use `Path.resolve()` and `Path.is_relative_to()` to check if the path is within the allowed directory.

```python
def generate_report(self, results: Dict[str, Any], output_path: Path) -> None:
    # Define the allowed output directory
    allowed_output_dir = Path("/path/to/allowed/output/dir")
    
    # Validate and sanitize the output path
    resolved_output_path = output_path.resolve()
    if not resolved_output_path.is_relative_to(allowed_output_dir):
        raise ValueError("Invalid output path")
    
    # ... rest of the method ...
```

### 2. Improper Error Handling and Information Leakage

*   **Vulnerability:** The `generate_report` method catches all exceptions and logs only the error message, potentially leaking sensitive information.
*   **Fix:** Log the exception with its traceback to provide more context, and consider logging sensitive information at a higher log level (e.g., DEBUG).

```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error generating report: {str(e)}")
    logger.debug(traceback.format_exc())
```

### 3. Hardcoded Secrets

*   **Vulnerability:** The code does not appear to have hardcoded secrets, but the logging configuration might be set up elsewhere in the project. If sensitive information like database credentials or API keys is hardcoded in the logging configuration, it could be a security risk.
*   **Fix:** Ensure that sensitive information is not hardcoded and instead use environment variables or a secure secrets management system.

### 4. Insecure Use of Cryptographic Functions

*   **Vulnerability:** The code does not appear to use cryptographic functions directly. However, if cryptographic functions are used elsewhere in the project (e.g., for data encryption), insecure usage could be a risk.
*   **Fix:** Ensure that cryptographic functions are used securely, following best practices and guidelines for the specific library or framework being used.

### 5. Authentication and Authorization Flaws

*   **Vulnerability:** The code does not appear to have authentication or authorization mechanisms in place, as it's focused on generating reports.
*   **Fix:** If the report generator is part of a larger system, ensure that proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to control access to the report generation functionality.

### 6. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** The code does not appear to be directly vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, as it does not interact with a database.
*   **Fix:** If database interactions are added in the future, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### 7. Command Injection Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** The code does not appear to be directly vulnerable to command injection attacks, as it does not execute system commands.
*   **Fix:** If system commands are executed in the future, use secure methods like `subprocess.run()` with `shell=False` and validate/sanitize input to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.

## Recommendations

*   Implement secure logging practices, including log rotation and sensitive information handling.
*   Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system for sensitive information.
*   Validate and sanitize all user-provided input, including file paths and report data.
*   Consider implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms if the report generator is part of a larger system.

## Updated Code

Here's an updated version of the `generate_report` method with some of the suggested fixes:

```python
import logging
import traceback
from pathlib import Path

# Define the allowed output directory
allowed_output_dir = Path("/path/to/allowed/output/dir")

def generate_report(self, results: Dict[str, Any], output_path: Path) -> None:
    try:
        # Validate and sanitize the output path
        resolved_output_path = output_path.resolve()
        if not resolved_output_path.is_relative_to(allowed_output_dir):
            raise ValueError("Invalid output path")
        
        # Generate markdown report
        if output_path.suffix.lower() == ".md":
            self._generate_markdown_report(results, output_path)
        # Generate JSON report
        elif output_path.suffix.lower() == ".json":
            self._generate_json_report(results, output_path)
        else:
            # Default to markdown
            self._generate_markdown_report(results, output_path)
            
        logger.info(f"Report generated successfully: {output_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error generating report: {str(e)}")
        logger.debug(traceback.format_exc())
```

--------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:

## 1. Inefficient algorithms or data structures

*   The code uses a list to store the report content and then joins it using `"\n".join(report)`. This is inefficient for large reports because it involves creating a new string for each append operation. 
*   The `_generate_markdown_report` method uses a dictionary to group issues by file, which is efficient. However, it then sorts the files by the number of issues in descending order using `sorted(issues_by_file.keys(), key=lambda x: len(issues_by_file[x]), reverse=True)`. This has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting.

## 2. Repeated computations that could be cached

*   The code recomputes `stats['files_scanned']` and `stats['total_issues']` every time a report is generated. If these values don't change, they could be computed once and cached.

## 3. Unnecessary resource usage

*   The code opens the output file in write mode (`"w"`), which will overwrite any existing file with the same name. If the file already exists and its content is needed, it will be lost. 
*   The code uses `logger.error(f"Error generating report: {str(e)}")` which converts the exception to a string. This can be inefficient if the exception contains a lot of information.

## 4. Database query inefficiencies

*   There are no database queries in this code snippet.

## 5. Memory leaks or excessive memory usage

*   The code stores the entire report in memory before writing it to the file. For very large reports, this could lead to excessive memory usage.

## 6. Threading or concurrency issues

*   The code does not appear to use threading or concurrency.

# Explanation of changes:

*   **Inefficient string concatenation**: Instead of storing the report content in a list and then joining it, the report is now written directly to the file. This reduces memory usage and improves performance for large reports.
*   **Repeated computations**: The code still recomputes `stats['files_scanned']` and `stats['total_issues']` every time a report is generated. Consider caching these values if they don't change.
*   **Unnecessary resource usage**: The code now opens the output file in write mode (`"w"`), which will overwrite any existing file with the same name. Consider adding a check to avoid overwriting existing files.
*   **Error handling**: The code now logs exceptions with `exc_info=True` to include the exception's traceback.
*   **Memory usage**: The code now writes the report directly to the file, which reduces memory usage.

# Tests and example uses:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    report_generator = ReportGenerator()
    
    results = {
        "issues": [
            {"file_path": "file1.py", "category": "security", "subcategory": " vulnerability", "description": "This is a security issue"},
            {"file_path": "file1.py", "category": "style", "subcategory": "convention", "description": "This is a style issue"},
            {"file_path": "file2.py", "category": "security", "subcategory": " vulnerability", "description": "This is another security issue"},
        ],
        "stats": {
            "files_scanned": 2,
            "total_issues": 3,
            "categories": {
                "security": 2,
                "style": 1,
            },
        },
    }
    
    output_path = Path("report.md")
    report_generator.generate_report(results, output_path)
```

This example generates a markdown report with the given results and saves it to `report.md`. You can modify the `results` dictionary to test different scenarios.

--------------------------------------------------
SECURITY ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

### Security Vulnerability Analysis

The provided code appears to be a part of a larger system for scanning Python code for security vulnerabilities and performance issues using the Cerebras-hosted Llama 4 model. While the code seems well-structured and follows good practices, there are several potential security vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.

#### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

* **Vulnerability:** The code does not directly interact with databases or execute SQL queries. However, it scans SQL files and uses the Cerebras API to analyze code. If the API or the model output is used to generate SQL queries without proper sanitization, it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Fix:** Ensure that any SQL queries generated based on the model's output or API responses are properly parameterized and sanitized.

#### 2. Command Injection Vulnerabilities

* **Vulnerability:** The code does not directly execute system commands. However, if the `os` module is used elsewhere in the codebase or if the Cerebras API or model output is used to execute system commands without proper sanitization, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
* **Fix:** Avoid using `os.system()`, `subprocess.run()`, or similar functions with unsanitized input. If necessary, use parameterized commands or whitelisting to prevent injection.

#### 3. Path Traversal Issues

* **Vulnerability:** The `scan_codebase` method takes a `path` parameter, which is used to scan files or directories. If not properly validated, an attacker could potentially traverse the file system.
* **Fix:** Validate and normalize the `path` parameter using `Path.resolve()` or similar methods to prevent path traversal. Ensure that the path is within a designated scanning directory.

```python
path = Path(path).resolve()
if not path.is_relative_to("/designated/scanning/directory"):
    logger.error("Invalid path")
    return results
```

#### 4. Authentication and Authorization Flaws

* **Vulnerability:** The code uses an API key for the Cerebras SDK, which is retrieved from the configuration or an environment variable. However, there is no explicit authentication or authorization mechanism within the provided code.
* **Fix:** Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC), to restrict access to the code scanning functionality.

#### 5. Improper Error Handling and Information Leakage

* **Vulnerability:** The code catches exceptions and logs error messages, but it does not handle errors uniformly. In some cases, it returns empty results or simply logs the error without providing useful information.
* **Fix:** Implement uniform error handling and logging mechanisms that provide useful information without leaking sensitive data. Consider using a centralized error handling system.

```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error scanning file {file_path}: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
    # Return a standardized error response or raise a custom exception
```

#### 6. Hardcoded Secrets

* **Vulnerability:** The code does not appear to have hardcoded secrets. However, the `config` dictionary may contain sensitive information, such as API keys.
* **Fix:** Ensure that sensitive information, such as API keys, is stored securely using environment variables, secure configuration files, or a secrets management system.

#### 7. Insecure Use of Cryptographic Functions

* **Vulnerability:** The code does not appear to use cryptographic functions directly. However, if cryptographic functions are used elsewhere in the codebase or in the Cerebras API, they may be used insecurely.
* **Fix:** Ensure that any cryptographic functions used are secure and follow best practices, such as using secure protocols (e.g., TLS) for communication and secure key management.

### Additional Recommendations

* Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
* Implement secure logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect potential security incidents.
* Regularly review and update the code to ensure it remains secure and follows best practices.

### Updated Code

The updated code should address the identified vulnerabilities and follow best practices for security. Here's an example of how the `scan_codebase` method could be updated to prevent path traversal:

```python
def scan_codebase(self, path: Union[str, Path], categories: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    try:
        path = Path(path).resolve()
        base_dir = Path("/designated/scanning/directory").resolve()
        if not path.is_relative_to(base_dir):
            logger.error("Invalid path")
            return {"issues": [], "stats": {}}
        
        # ... (rest of the method remains the same)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error scanning codebase: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
        return {"issues": [], "stats": {}}
```

--------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

### Performance Analysis Report

The provided code appears to be well-structured and readable. However, several performance issues and potential optimizations have been identified.

#### 1. Inefficient Algorithms or Data Structures

*   The `scan_codebase` method uses the `glob` method to find files recursively, which can be slow for large directories. Consider using `os.walk()` or `pathlib.Path.rglob()` instead.
*   The `_parse_response` method uses regular expressions to extract bullet points from the model's response. While this works, it may not be the most efficient approach, especially for large responses. Consider using a dedicated markdown parsing library.

#### 2. Repeated Computations that Could be Cached

*   The `get_file_language` function is called for each file in the `scan_codebase` method. If this function is expensive or has significant overhead, consider caching its results.
*   The `prompt_manager.get_prompts` method is called for each file in the `scan_file` method. If this method has significant overhead, consider caching its results.

#### 3. Unnecessary Resource Usage

*   The `scan_codebase` method opens and reads the entire file into memory. For large files, this can be inefficient. Consider using a streaming approach or reading files in chunks.
*   The `_call_cerebras_api` method calls the Cerebras API for each chunk of code. If the API has rate limits or significant latency, consider batching requests or using a queue to manage requests.

#### 4. Database Query Inefficiencies

*   There are no explicit database queries in the provided code. However, the Cerebras API calls may involve database queries under the hood. Consider optimizing API calls or using a caching layer.

#### 5. Memory Leaks or Excessive Memory Usage

*   The `scan_codebase` method stores the results of all file scans in memory. For large codebases, this can lead to excessive memory usage. Consider using a streaming approach or writing results to disk.
*   The `_parse_response` method stores the entire response in memory. For large responses, this can be inefficient. Consider using a streaming approach or parsing the response in chunks.

#### 6. Threading or Concurrency Issues

*   The `scan_codebase` method scans files sequentially. Consider using a thread pool or concurrent.futures to parallelize file scans and improve performance.
*   The `_call_cerebras_api` method calls the Cerebras API sequentially. Consider using a thread pool or concurrent.futures to parallelize API calls and improve performance.

### Optimization Suggestions

#### Use Efficient File Globbing

Replace `path.glob(pattern)` with `path.rglob(pattern)` to improve performance.

```python
for pattern in ["*.py", "*.sql"]:
    for file_path in path.rglob(pattern):
        # ...
```

#### Cache File Language and Prompts

Implement a caching layer for `get_file_language` and `prompt_manager.get_prompts` to reduce repeated computations.

```python
file_language_cache = {}

def get_file_language_cached(file_path):
    if file_path in file_language_cache:
        return file_language_cache[file_path]
    language = get_file_language(file_path)
    file_language_cache[file_path] = language
    return language
```

#### Use Streaming Approach for File Reading

Replace `with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f: code = f.read()` with a streaming approach using `readline()` or `readlines()`.

```python
with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    code = ""
    for line in f:
        code += line
        # ...
```

#### Batch Cerebras API Calls

Implement a batching layer for Cerebras API calls to reduce overhead and improve performance.

```python
api_call_batch = []

def _call_cerebras_api_batched(prompt):
    api_call_batch.append(prompt)
    if len(api_call_batch) >= batch_size:
        # Call Cerebras API with batched prompts
        responses = self.cerebras_sdk.generate(
            model=self.model_name,
            prompt=api_call_batch,
            max_tokens=self.config.get("max_response_tokens", 2048),
            temperature=self.config.get("temperature", 0.2),
            top_p=self.config.get("top_p", 0.95),
        )
        api_call_batch.clear()
        return responses
```

#### Use Thread Pool for Parallelization

Implement a thread pool using `concurrent.futures` to parallelize file scans and Cerebras API calls.

```python
import concurrent.futures

def scan_file_parallel(file_path):
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        future = executor.submit(self.scan_file, file_path)
        return future.result()

# Usage
results = []
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(scan_file_parallel, file_path) for file_path in file_paths]
    for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
        results.extend(future.result())
```

### Refactored Code Example

```python
import os
import re
import json
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any, Union
import logging
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

from cerebras.cloud.sdk import CerebrasCloudSDK
from scanner.prompt_manager import PromptManager
from scanner.utils import chunk_code, get_file_language

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class CodeAnalyzer:
    # ...

    def scan_codebase(self, path: Union[str, Path], categories: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        path = Path(path)
        results = {

        }

        file_paths = []
        if path.is_file():
            file_paths.append(path)
        elif path.is_dir():
            for pattern in ["*.py", "*.sql"]:
                file_paths.extend(path.rglob(pattern))

        with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
            futures = [executor.submit(self.scan_file, file_path, categories) for file_path in file_paths]
            for future in futures:
                file_results = future.result()
                results["issues"].extend(file_results)
                results["stats"]["files_scanned"] += 1

        # Update statistics
        results["stats"]["total_issues"] = len(results["issues"])

        # Count issues by category
        for issue in results["issues"]:
            category = issue["category"]
            if category not in results["stats"]["categories"]:
                results["stats"]["categories"][category] = 0
            results["stats"]["categories"][category] += 1

        return results

    def _call_cerebras_api_batched(self, prompts):
        batch_size = 10
        api_call_batch = []

        for prompt in prompts:
            api_call_batch.append(prompt)

                )
                api_call_batch.clear()
                yield from responses

        if api_call_batch:
            responses = self.cerebras_sdk.generate(
                model=self.model_name,

            )
            yield from responses

SECURITY ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

# Step-by-step analysis of the code:

### SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

1. **Vulnerability:** The `get_user_data` function is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The `user_id` variable is directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
2. **Explanation:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code by providing a specially crafted `user_id` value, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
3. **Fix:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate the SQL code from the user input.

```python
def get_user_data(user_id):
    cursor = db.cursor()
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
    cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
    return cursor.fetchall()
```

### Hardcoded Secrets

1. **Vulnerability:** The `connect_to_db` function uses hardcoded database credentials (username and password).
2. **Explanation:** Hardcoding sensitive information like database credentials can lead to unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
3. **Fix:** Store sensitive information in environment variables or a secure secrets management system.

```python
import os

def connect_to_db():
    username = os.environ.get("DB_USERNAME")
    password = os.environ.get("DB_PASSWORD")
    return psycopg2.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user=username,
        password=password
    )
```

### Command Injection Vulnerabilities

1. **Vulnerability:** The `ping_host` function is vulnerable to command injection attacks. The `host` variable is directly inserted into the system command without proper sanitization or validation.
2. **Explanation:** An attacker can inject malicious system commands by providing a specially crafted `host` value, potentially leading to unauthorized system access or data breaches.
3. **Fix:** Use a whitelist approach to validate the input, or use a library that provides a safe way to execute system commands.

```python
import subprocess

def ping_host(host):
    # Whitelist validation
    if not host.replace('.', '', 3).isdigit():
        raise ValueError("Invalid host IP address")
    
    # Use subprocess.run with shell=False to prevent command injection
    subprocess.run(["ping", "-c", "4", host])
```

### Authentication and Authorization Flaws

No authentication or authorization flaws were found in the provided code.

### Improper Error Handling and Information Leakage

No improper error handling or information leakage issues were found in the provided code.

### Path Traversal Issues

No path traversal issues were found in the provided code.

### Insecure use of Cryptographic Functions

No insecure use of cryptographic functions was found in the provided code.

# Fixed solution:

The fixed solution will be provided for each vulnerable function:

```python

    print("SQL Injection Analysis:", result)
    
    # Test hardcoded credentials

    )
    """

    # Whitelist validation
    if not host.replace('.', '', 3).isdigit():
        raise ValueError("Invalid host IP address")

    subprocess.run(["ping", "-c", "4", host])
    """
    
    print("\nTesting command injection detection...")
    result = await scanner.analyze_code(cmd_code, "input_validation")
    print("Command Injection Analysis:", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(test_scanner()) 
```

# Explanation of changes:

*   **SQL Injection Fix:** Replaced the vulnerable SQL query with a parameterized query using `%s` as a placeholder for the `user_id` variable.
*   **Hardcoded Credentials Fix:** Replaced hardcoded database credentials with environment variables (`DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD`).
*   **Command Injection Fix:** Implemented whitelist validation for the `host` variable and used `subprocess.run` with `shell=False` to prevent command injection.

# Tests and example uses:

To test the fixed solution, you can use the following example:

```python
import unittest

class TestSecurityFixes(unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase):
    async def test_sql_injection_fix(self):
        # Test the fixed SQL injection vulnerability
        user_id = 1
        cursor = db.cursor()
        query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
        cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
        result = cursor.fetchall()
        self.assertIsNotNone(result)

    async def test_hardcoded_credentials_fix(self):
        # Test the fixed hardcoded credentials vulnerability
        try:
            conn = connect_to_db()
            self.assertIsNotNone(conn)
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(str(e))

    async def test_command_injection_fix(self):
        # Test the fixed command injection vulnerability
        host = "8.8.8.8"
        try:
            ping_host(host)
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(str(e))

    unittest.main()
```

--------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

Analysis of Performance Issues
==============================

### 1. Inefficient Algorithms or Data Structures

*   The provided code does not exhibit any obvious inefficient algorithms or data structures. However, the `CodeScanner` class and its `analyze_code` method are not shown in the given code snippet. If these methods are not optimized, it could lead to performance issues.

### 2. Repeated Computations that could be Cached

*   The `CodeScanner` class's `analyze_code` method is called multiple times with different code snippets. If this method performs expensive computations that do not depend on the input code snippet, consider caching the results to avoid repeated computations.

### 3. Unnecessary Resource Usage

*   The `psycopg2` library is imported but not used efficiently. The connection to the database is not established or closed properly. Consider using a context manager to ensure the connection is closed after use.

### 4. Database Query Inefficiencies

*   The database query in the `sql_code` snippet is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. However, in a real-world scenario, consider using parameterized queries or prepared statements to improve performance and security.

### 5. Memory Leaks or Excessive Memory Usage

*   The provided code does not exhibit any obvious memory leaks. However, if the `CodeScanner` class or its methods create large objects that are not properly garbage collected, it could lead to memory issues.

### 6. Threading or Concurrency Issues

*   The code uses asyncio for asynchronous execution, which is good for concurrency. However, if the `CodeScanner` class's `analyze_code` method is not designed to be asynchronous, it could block other tasks and lead to performance issues.

Optimization Suggestions
------------------------

### Optimize the `CodeScanner` Class

*   Ensure the `CodeScanner` class's methods are optimized for performance, especially if they perform expensive computations.
*   Consider caching the results of expensive computations to avoid repeated computations.

### Use Parameterized Queries

*   Instead of using string formatting for database queries, use parameterized queries to improve performance and security.

### Properly Handle Database Connections

*   Use a context manager to ensure database connections are properly closed after use.

### Asynchronous Execution

*   Ensure the `CodeScanner` class's methods are designed to be asynchronous to take full advantage of asyncio.

### Example Optimized Code

```python
import asyncio
from scanner.cerebras_scanner import CodeScanner
import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import sql

async def test_scanner():
    # Initialize the scanner
    scanner = CodeScanner()
    
    # Test SQL injection vulnerability
    sql_code = """
def get_user_data(user_id):
    cursor = db.cursor()
    query = sql.SQL("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s")
    cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
    return cursor.fetchall()
    """
    
    print("Testing SQL injection detection...")
    result = await scanner.analyze_code(sql_code, "sql_injection")
    print("SQL Injection Analysis:", result)
    
    # Test hardcoded credentials
    auth_code = """
def connect_to_db():
    username = "admin"
    password = "password123"
    return psycopg2.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user=username,
        password=password
    )
    """
    
    print("\nTesting hardcoded credentials detection...")
    result = await scanner.analyze_code(auth_code, "auth")
    print("Auth Analysis:", result)
    
    # Test command injection
    cmd_code = """
def ping_host(host):
    import os
    os.system(f"ping -c 4 {host}")
    """
    
    print("\nTesting command injection detection...")
    result = await scanner.analyze_code(cmd_code, "input_validation")
    print("Command Injection Analysis:", result)

async def main():
    try:
        async with await test_scanner():
            pass
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

However, the best optimization would be in the `CodeScanner` class and its `analyze_code` method, which are not shown in the given code snippet.

Improved `CodeScanner` Class Example
------------------------------------

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Dict

class CodeScanner:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize a cache to store results of expensive computations
        self.cache: Dict[str, str] = {}

    async def analyze_code(self, code: str, vulnerability: str) -> str:
        # Check if the result is already cached
        if code in self.cache:
            return self.cache[code]

        # Perform expensive computation or analysis
        # ...

        # Cache the result
        self.cache[code] = result
        return result
```

In this example, the `CodeScanner` class uses a cache to store the results of expensive computations. Before performing the computation, it checks if the result is already cached. If it is, it returns the cached result instead of recomputing it. This optimization can significantly improve performance if the `analyze_code` method is called multiple times with the same input.

SECURITY ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

# Security Analysis Report

The provided code is a Streamlit application that offers an AI-powered Python security scanner. The analysis focuses on seven key areas of security vulnerabilities.

## 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

**Vulnerability:** 
The code does not appear to directly execute SQL queries. However, it analyzes user-provided Python code for SQL injection vulnerabilities. If the analysis results are not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code.

**Fix:** 
Ensure that any user-provided input or analysis results are properly sanitized and validated before being used or displayed.

## 2. Command Injection Vulnerabilities

**Vulnerability:** 
The code uses the `CodeScanner` class to analyze user-provided Python code. However, there is no indication that it executes system commands based on user input. 

**Fix:** 
If system commands are executed in the future, use parameterized commands or whitelisting to prevent command injection.

## 3. Path Traversal Issues

**Vulnerability:** 
The code does not appear to handle file paths directly. However, the `CodeScanner` class might potentially read or write files. 

**Fix:** 
If file operations are performed, ensure that paths are properly sanitized and validated to prevent path traversal attacks.

## 4. Authentication and Authorization Flaws

**Vulnerability:** 
The code does not appear to handle user authentication or authorization. This could lead to unauthorized access to the scanner's functionality.

**Fix:** 
Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as user roles and access controls, to restrict access to authorized users.

## 5. Improper Error Handling and Information Leakage

**Vulnerability:** 
The code catches exceptions and displays error messages to the user. However, it does not appear to handle sensitive information properly.

**Fix:** 
Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms to prevent information leakage. Ensure that error messages do not reveal sensitive information.

## 6. Hardcoded Secrets

**Vulnerability:** 
There are no apparent hardcoded secrets in the provided code.

**Fix:** 
Ensure that any secrets or sensitive information are stored securely and not hardcoded.

## 7. Insecure Use of Cryptographic Functions

**Vulnerability:** 
The code does not appear to use cryptographic functions directly.

**Fix:** 
If cryptographic functions are used in the future, ensure that they are used securely and follow best practices.

### Code-Specific Recommendations

- **Input Validation:** 
  Validate and sanitize user-provided input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

- **Secure Analysis Results:** 
  Ensure that analysis results are properly sanitized and validated before being displayed.

- **Error Handling:** 
  Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms to prevent information leakage.

### Updated Code Example

Here's an example of how you can improve error handling and input validation:

```python
import streamlit as st
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
import sys
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Add the parent directory to Python path so we can import our scanner
sys.path.append(str(Path(__file__).parent.parent))
from scanner.cerebras_scanner import CodeScanner

st.set_page_config(
    page_title="AI-Powered Python Security Scanner",
    page_icon="🔒",
    layout="wide"
)

# Initialize the scanner
@st.cache_resource
def get_scanner():
    return CodeScanner()

def main():
    st.title("AI-Powered Python Security Scanner")
    st.markdown("""
    This tool uses Cerebras + Llama 4 to analyze Python code for security vulnerabilities
    and performance issues. Simply paste your code below and select the type of analysis
    you want to perform.
    """)
    
    # Code input
    code = st.text_area("Enter your Python code here:", height=300)
    
    # Analysis options
    analysis_type = st.multiselect(
        "Select analysis categories:",
        ["SQL Injection", "Authentication", "Input Validation", "Cryptographic Issues"],
        default=["SQL Injection", "Authentication"]
    )
    
    if st.button("Analyze Code"):
        try:
            if not code:
                st.error("Please enter some code to analyze.")
                return
            
            # Validate and sanitize input
            code = code.strip()
            if not code:
                st.error("Invalid input. Please enter valid Python code.")
                return
            
            scanner = get_scanner()
            
            # Show a spinner while analyzing
            with st.spinner("Analyzing code..."):
                # Create tasks for each selected category
                tasks = []
                for category in analysis_type:
                    category_key = category.lower().replace(" ", "_")
                    tasks.append(scanner.analyze_code(code, category_key))
                
                # Run all analysis tasks concurrently
                results = asyncio.run(asyncio.gather(*tasks))
                
                # Display results
                for category, result in zip(analysis_type, results):
                    st.subheader(f"{category} Analysis")
                    
                    if "error" in result:
                        # Log the error and display a sanitized message
                        logging.error(f"Error during analysis: {result['error']}")
                        st.error("An error occurred during analysis.")
                        continue
                        
                    if not result.get("issues"):
                        st.success("No issues found in this category.")
                    else:
                        for issue in result["issues"]:
                            st.warning(
                                f"""
                                **Issue Found:**
                                {issue.get('description', 'No description available')}
                                
                                **Fix:**
                                {issue.get('fix', 'No fix suggestion available')}
                                """
                            )
                            
        except Exception as e:
            # Log the error and display a sanitized message
            logging.error(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
            st.error("An error occurred. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this updated example, input validation and sanitization have been added, and error handling has been improved to prevent information leakage. Additionally, logging has been configured to handle errors securely.

--------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

**Performance Analysis and Optimization Suggestions**

### 1. Inefficient Algorithms or Data Structures

*   **Problem:** The provided code does not exhibit obvious inefficient algorithms or data structures. However, the `CodeScanner` class and its `analyze_code` method are not shown in the given code snippet. If these methods are not optimized, it could lead to performance issues.

*   **Optimization:** Ensure that the `CodeScanner` class and its methods are optimized for performance.

### 2. Repeated Computations that Could be Cached

*   **Problem:** The `get_scanner` function is decorated with `@st.cache_resource`, which caches the result so that subsequent calls return the cached value instead of re-creating the `CodeScanner` instance.

*   **Optimization:** This caching is already implemented and is a good practice to avoid repeated computations.

### 3. Unnecessary Resource Usage

*   **Problem:** The `CodeScanner` instance is created and cached using `@st.cache_resource`. If the `CodeScanner` instance is not properly cleaned up, it could lead to unnecessary resource usage.

*   **Optimization:** Ensure that the `CodeScanner` instance is properly cleaned up when it is no longer needed. Consider using a `try-finally` block or a context manager to ensure that resources are released.

### 4. Database Query Inefficiencies

*   **Problem:** There are no apparent database queries in the provided code snippet.

*   **Optimization:** If database queries are added in the future, ensure that they are optimized by using efficient query methods, indexing, and caching.

### 5. Memory Leaks or Excessive Memory Usage

*   **Problem:** The code uses a text area to input code, which could potentially lead to excessive memory usage if the input code is very large.

*   **Optimization:** Consider implementing a limit on the input code size to prevent excessive memory usage. Additionally, ensure that the `CodeScanner` instance and its methods do not cause memory leaks.

### 6. Threading or Concurrency Issues

*   **Problem:** The code uses `asyncio` to run analysis tasks concurrently, which is a good practice to improve performance.

*   **Optimization:** Ensure that the `analyze_code` method is properly designed to handle concurrent execution. Consider using `asyncio.gather` with a `return_exceptions=True` argument to handle exceptions properly.

**Additional Suggestions:**

*   **Error Handling:** Improve error handling by providing more informative error messages and handling specific exceptions instead of catching the general `Exception` class.
*   **Input Validation:** Validate user input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

Here's an updated version of the code incorporating some of these suggestions:

```python

SECURITY ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

Analysis Report
================

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** The provided code does not directly interact with a database, so there are no SQL injection vulnerabilities in this specific code. However, the code is designed to analyze other Python code for security issues, including SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Fix:** Ensure that the analyzed code is properly sanitized and validated to prevent SQL injection attacks. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases.

### 2. Command Injection Vulnerabilities

*   **Vulnerability:** The provided code does not execute any system commands, so there are no command injection vulnerabilities in this specific code. However, if the analyzed code executes system commands, ensure that user input is properly sanitized and validated to prevent command injection attacks.
*   **Fix:** Use the `subprocess` module's `run` function with the `shell=False` argument to prevent shell injection attacks. Avoid using `os.system` or `exec` functions.

### 3. Path Traversal Issues

*   **Vulnerability:** The provided code does not interact with the file system in a way that could lead to path traversal issues. However, if the analyzed code reads or writes files, ensure that file paths are properly sanitized and validated to prevent path traversal attacks.
*   **Fix:** Use the `pathlib` module to construct file paths, and ensure that user input is properly validated and sanitized.

### 4. Authentication and Authorization Flaws

*   **Vulnerability:** The provided code uses an API key for authentication with the Cerebras API, but it does not handle authentication or authorization for the analyzed code. If the analyzed code handles authentication or authorization, ensure that it is properly implemented.
*   **Fix:** Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth or JWT, and ensure that sensitive data is properly protected.

### 5. Improper Error Handling and Information Leakage

*   **Vulnerability:** The provided code catches all exceptions and returns a generic error message, which could potentially leak information about the error. Additionally, the `_parse_response` method does not properly parse the response from the Cerebras API, which could lead to errors.
*   **Fix:** Implement proper error handling mechanisms, such as logging errors and returning generic error messages. Ensure that sensitive data is not leaked in error messages.

### 6. Hardcoded Secrets

*   **Vulnerability:** The provided code loads the `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` environment variable, which is a good practice. However, the code does not handle cases where the environment variable is not set or is empty.
*   **Fix:** Ensure that the `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` environment variable is properly set and validated. Consider using a secrets manager to handle sensitive data.

### 7. Insecure Use of Cryptographic Functions

*   **Vulnerability:** The provided code does not use any cryptographic functions, so there are no insecure uses of cryptographic functions in this specific code.
*   **Fix:** N/A

Code Improvements
-----------------

Here are some code improvements to address the mentioned vulnerabilities and issues:

### Improved Error Handling

```python
try:
    # Call Cerebras API for inference
    response = await self.client.generate(
        model=self.model,
        prompt=formatted_prompt,
        max_tokens=1000,
        temperature=0.1,  # Low temperature for more focused analysis
        top_p=0.9,
        top_k=50,
        stop=["```"]  # Stop when code block ends
    )
except Exception as e:
    # Log the error and return a generic error message
    logging.error(f"Error analyzing code: {str(e)}")
    return {
        "error": "Failed to analyze code",
        "category": category,
        "issues": []
    }
```

### Improved Response Parsing

```python
def _parse_response(self, response: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    try:
        # Implement proper parsing based on the response format
        # For example, using JSON parsing
        return json.loads(response)
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        # Log the error and return a generic error message
        logging.error(f"Error parsing response: {str(e)}")
        return {
            "raw_response": response,
            "issues": []
        }
```

### Environment Variable Validation

```python
def __init__(self):
    """Initialize the scanner with Cerebras API client."""
    api_key = os.getenv("CEREBRAS_API_KEY")
    if not api_key:
        raise ValueError("CEREBRAS_API_KEY environment variable not found or empty")
    if not isinstance(api_key, str) or not api_key.strip():
        raise ValueError("CEREBRAS_API_KEY environment variable is empty or not a string")
    
    self.client = CerebrasAPI(api_key=api_key)
    # ...
```

### Secure Prompt Template Loading

```python
def _get_prompt_template(self, category: str) -> str:
    """Get the appropriate prompt template for a category."""
    try:
        # Load prompt templates from a configuration file
        with open("prompt_templates.json", "r") as f:
            templates = json.load(f)
        return templates.get(category, "")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Log the error and return a generic error message
        logging.error("Prompt template file not found")
        return ""
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        # Log the error and return a generic error message
        logging.error(f"Error loading prompt templates: {str(e)}")
        return ""
```

--------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------

# Performance Analysis and Optimization Suggestions

## 1. Inefficient Algorithms or Data Structures

### Issue: 
The current implementation of `_get_prompt_template` method uses a dictionary to store prompt templates. While this approach is not inherently inefficient, it could become cumbersome and hard to maintain if the number of templates grows. 

### Optimization:
Consider using a configuration file (e.g., JSON or YAML) to store prompt templates. This would allow for easier maintenance and updates without modifying the code.

```python
import json

def _get_prompt_template(self, category: str) -> str:
    try:
        with open('prompt_templates.json') as f:
            templates = json.load(f)
            return templates.get(category, "")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Handle the case when the file does not exist
        return ""
```

## 2. Repeated Computations that Could be Cached

### Issue:
The `_get_prompt_template` method is called every time `analyze_code` is invoked, which could lead to repeated computations if the same category is analyzed multiple times.

### Optimization:
Implement a caching mechanism using a dictionary to store recently used prompt templates.

```python
class CodeScanner:
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.prompt_templates_cache = {}

    def _get_prompt_template(self, category: str) -> str:
        if category in self.prompt_templates_cache:
            return self.prompt_templates_cache[category]
        
        # Load the prompt template
        try:
            with open('prompt_templates.json') as f:
                templates = json.load(f)
                self.prompt_templates_cache[category] = templates.get(category, "")
                return self.prompt_templates_cache[category]
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # Handle the case when the file does not exist
            return ""
```

## 3. Unnecessary Resource Usage

### Issue:
The `CerebrasAPI` client is created every time an instance of `CodeScanner` is created. If multiple instances are created, this could lead to unnecessary resource usage.

### Optimization:
Consider using a singleton pattern or a factory method to ensure that only one instance of `CerebrasAPI` is created.

```python
class CerebrasAPIClient:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            api_key = os.getenv("CEREBRAS_API_KEY")
            if not api_key:
                raise ValueError("CEREBRAS_API_KEY environment variable not found")
            cls._instance = super(CerebrasAPIClient, cls).__new__(cls)
            cls._instance.client = CerebrasAPI(api_key=api_key)
        return cls._instance

class CodeScanner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = CerebrasAPIClient().client
        # ...
```

## 4. Database Query Inefficiencies

### Issue:
There are no explicit database queries in the provided code. However, the `CerebrasAPI` client might be making API calls that could be optimized.

### Optimization:
Consider implementing retry logic and timeouts for API calls to handle potential network issues.

```python
import asyncio
from async_timeout import timeout

async def analyze_code(self, code: str, category: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # ...
    try:
        async with timeout(30):  # 30-second timeout
            response = await self.client.generate(
                # ...
            )
        # ...
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        return {
            "error": "Timeout error",
            "category": category,
            "issues": []
        }
```

## 5. Memory Leaks or Excessive Memory Usage

### Issue:
The `CodeScanner` class stores prompt templates in memory. If the number of templates grows, this could lead to excessive memory usage.

### Optimization:
Consider using a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache to store prompt templates, which would help limit memory usage.

```python
from functools import lru_cache

class CodeScanner:
    @lru_cache(maxsize=128)  # Cache up to 128 prompt templates
    def _get_prompt_template(self, category: str) -> str:
        # ...
```

## 6. Threading or Concurrency Issues

### Issue:
The `analyze_code` method is asynchronous, but there is no explicit concurrency control.

### Optimization:
Consider using a semaphore to limit the number of concurrent API calls.

```python
import asyncio

semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(5)  # Allow up to 5 concurrent API calls

async def analyze_code(self, code: str, category: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    async with semaphore:
        # ...
```

### Complete Optimized Code

Here's an example of how the optimized code could look:

```python
import os
import json
from typing import List, Dict, Any
from cerebras_cloud_sdk import CerebrasAPI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import asyncio
from async_timeout import timeout
from functools import lru_cache

load_dotenv()

class CerebrasAPIClient:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            api_key = os.getenv("CEREBRAS_API_KEY")
            if not api_key:
                raise ValueError("CEREBRAS_API_KEY environment variable not found")
            cls._instance = super(CerebrasAPIClient, cls).__new__(cls)
            cls._instance.client = CerebrasAPI(api_key=api_key)
        return cls._instance

class CodeScanner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = CerebrasAPIClient().client
        self.model = "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf"
        self.semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(5)  # Allow up to 5 concurrent API calls

    @lru_cache(maxsize=128)  # Cache up to 128 prompt templates
    def _get_prompt_template(self, category: str) -> str:
        try:
            with open('prompt_templates.json') as f:
                templates = json.load(f)
                return templates.get(category, "")
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # Handle the case when the file does not exist
            return ""

    async def analyze_code(self, code: str, category: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        async with self.semaphore:
            prompt = self._get_prompt_template(category)
            formatted_prompt = prompt.format(code=code)
            
            try:
                async with timeout(30):  # 30-second timeout
                    response = await self.client.generate(
                        model=self.model,
                        prompt=formatted_prompt,
                        max_tokens=1000,
                        temperature=0.1,  
                        top_p=0.9,
                        top_k=50,
                        stop=["```"]  
                    )
                    return self._parse_response(response.text if hasattr(response, 'text') else response)
            except Exception as e:
                return {
                    "error": str(e),
                    "category": category,
                    "issues": []
                }

    def _parse_response(self, response: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Implement proper parsing based on the response format
        return {
            "raw_response": response,
            "issues": []  
        }
```
