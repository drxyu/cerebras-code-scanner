## Analysis Results

### 1. Maintainability: Duplicate Code

## ANALYSIS 1: MAINTAINABILITY: Duplicate Code
The provided Python code does not exhibit significant duplication of code blocks or functionality within the given scope. However, there is a potential for duplication in the SQL query construction, particularly in how queries are formatted as strings. 

For instance, the `get_user_data`, `create_user`, and `search_users` functions all construct SQL queries by directly formatting strings with user-provided data. This approach not only introduces a risk of SQL injection but also represents a pattern that could be extracted into a separate function to improve maintainability and adhere to the DRY principle.

Example fix: Extract repeated code into a shared function or class method. For SQL queries, consider using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection and improve security. Here's a simplified example of how to refactor the query execution into a separate function:

```python
def execute_query(query, params=()):
    cursor.execute(query, params)
    return cursor.fetchall() if query.upper().startswith("SELECT") else None

# Example usage in get_user_data
def get_user_data(user_id):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id =?"
    return execute_query(query, (user_id,))

# Example usage in create_user
def create_user(username, password):
    query = "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?,?)"
    execute_query(query, (username, password))
    conn.commit()

# Example usage in search_users
def search_users(keyword):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE?"
    return execute_query(query, (f"%{keyword}%",))
```

### 2. Maintainability: Inconsistent Naming

## ANALYSIS 2: MAINTAINABILITY: Inconsistent Naming
The provided Python code generally follows the PEP 8 naming conventions, which is the standard style guide for Python. Variables and functions are named using snake_case, which is consistent and clear. However, there are no classes defined in the given code, so the naming convention for classes (PascalCase) is not applicable here.

One potential improvement could be in the naming of the `conn` and `cursor` variables. While they are commonly used names in the context of database connections, more descriptive names might improve readability, especially in larger projects. For example, `db_connection` and `db_cursor` could be more descriptive.

Example fix: Standardize on snake_case for variables and functions. For classes, if any were to be defined, PascalCase should be used. Consider using more descriptive names for variables like `conn` and `cursor`.

```python
# More descriptive variable names
db_connection = sqlite3.connect("users.db")
db_cursor = db_connection.cursor()
```

---

### 3. Maintainability: Long Function

## ANALYSIS 3: MAINTAINABILITY: Long Function
The provided Python code does not contain excessively long functions. Each function (`get_user_data`, `create_user`, `search_users`) has a single, well-defined responsibility and is concise. The main block under `if __name__ == "__main__":` could be considered a bit long because it includes both setup (connecting to the database, creating a table) and example usage. However, it's not excessively long or complex.

For better maintainability, the setup and example usage could be separated into different functions or even modules, especially if this script is intended to grow or be reused.

Example fix: Break down the main block into smaller functions, each with a single responsibility. For example, one function could handle database setup, and another could demonstrate example usage.

```python
def setup_database():
    db_connection = sqlite3.connect("users.db")
    db_cursor = db_connection.cursor()
    db_cursor.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        username TEXT,
        password TEXT
    )
    ''')
    return db_connection, db_cursor

def main():
    db_connection, db_cursor = setup_database()
    create_user("admin", "password123", db_cursor, db_connection)
    user = get_user_data(1, db_cursor)
    print(f"User: {user}")
    
    search_results = search_users("ad", db_cursor)
    print(f"Search results: {search_results}")
    
    db_connection.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note: The `create_user`, `get_user_data`, and `search_users` functions would also need to be modified to accept `db_cursor` and `db_connection` as parameters to work with this refactored structure. This example focuses on the main block's reorganization. 

```python
def create_user(username, password, cursor, conn):
    query = "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?,?)"
    cursor.execute(query, (username, password))
    conn.commit()

def get_user_data(user_id, cursor):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id =?"
    cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
    return cursor.fetchone()

def search_users(keyword, cursor):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE?"
    cursor.execute(query, (f"%{keyword}%",))
    return cursor.fetchall()
```

### 4. Maintainability: Magic Values

## ANALYSIS 1: MAINTAINABILITY: Magic Values
The provided Python code contains several instances of magic values. For example, the database filename "users.db" and the table name "users" are hardcoded. Additionally, the column names "id", "username", and "password" are also magic values. Using magic values can be problematic because they make the code less readable, maintainable, and flexible. If the database filename or table structure needs to be changed, it would require modifying the code in multiple places, which can lead to errors and inconsistencies.

To improve maintainability, it is recommended to define these magic values as named constants or configuration values. For instance, the database filename and table name can be defined as constants at the top of the file:
```python
DB_FILENAME = "users.db"
TABLE_NAME = "users"
```
Similarly, the column names can be defined as constants or enums to make the code more readable and self-explanatory.

---

### 5. Maintainability: Poor Error Handling

## ANALYSIS 2: MAINTAINABILITY: Poor Error Handling
The provided Python code lacks proper error handling. For example, the `create_user` function does not handle potential errors that may occur during database operations, such as duplicate usernames or database connection issues. The `get_user_data` and `search_users` functions also do not handle errors that may occur during query execution.

Proper error handling is crucial to ensure that the program behaves predictably and provides useful feedback in case of errors. To improve error handling, it is recommended to use specific exception catches and log errors instead of swallowing them. For instance:
```python
try:
    cursor.execute(query)
except sqlite3.Error as e:
    logger.error(f"Database error: {e}")
```
Additionally, it is a good practice to validate user input and handle potential errors that may occur during data processing.

---

### 6. Performance: Inefficient Data Structure

## ANALYSIS 3: PERFORMANCE: Inefficient Data Structure
The provided Python code uses a list to store the search results, which can be inefficient if the number of results is large. A more efficient approach would be to use a generator or an iterator to yield the results one by one, instead of loading all the results into memory at once.

For example, the `search_users` function can be modified to use a generator:
```python
def search_users(keyword):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%{keyword}%'"
    cursor.execute(query)
    for row in cursor:
        yield row
```
This approach can significantly improve performance when dealing with large datasets. However, it's worth noting that the current implementation of the `search_users` function is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, and a more secure approach would be to use parameterized queries or prepared statements.

In terms of data structures, the code does not have any obvious inefficiencies. However, the use of `fetchall()` in the `search_users` function can be inefficient if the number of results is large, as it loads all the results into memory at once. A more efficient approach would be to use `fetchone()` or `fetchmany()` to retrieve the results in batches. ```python
```# Example usage of fetchmany() to retrieve results in batches
batch_size = 100
results = []
while True:
    batch = cursor.fetchmany(batch_size)
    if not batch:
        break
    results.extend(batch)
```python
```python
# Example usage of fetchmany() to retrieve results in batches
batch_size = 100
results = []

    batch = cursor.fetchmany(batch_size)
    if not batch:
        break
    results.extend(batch)
```python

### 7. Performance: Inefficient I/O in Loop

## ANALYSIS 1: PERFORMANCE: Inefficient I/O in Loop
The provided Python code does not explicitly show inefficient I/O operations inside loops. However, the `create_user`, `get_user_data`, and `search_users` functions perform database operations for each call. If these functions are called within loops (not shown in the provided code), it could lead to inefficient I/O. 

For instance, if you were to create multiple users in a loop, the current implementation would result in a separate database insert operation for each user. This could be optimized by batching the insert operations. 

Example fix: Batch database operations instead of making separate calls for each item. 
```python
def create_users(users):
    """
    Create multiple users in the database
    """
    # Batch insert
    query = "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?,?)"
    cursor.executemany(query, [(user['username'], user['password']) for user in users])
    conn.commit()
```

### 8. Performance: Inefficient String Building

## ANALYSIS 2: PERFORMANCE: Inefficient String Building
The provided Python code uses f-strings for string formatting, which is generally efficient in Python. However, the `search_users` function uses string concatenation in the SQL query, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities and is not directly related to string building performance in Python. 

There are no obvious instances of inefficient string building patterns in the provided code, such as concatenation in a loop. 

However, it's worth noting that using f-strings or the `str.format()` method is generally more efficient and readable than concatenation for building strings in Python. 

Example fix: Instead of: 
```python
s = ''
for item in items:
    s += str(item)
```
Use: 
```python
s = ''.join(str(item) for item in items)
```

---

### 9. Performance: Lack of Vectorization

## ANALYSIS 3: PERFORMANCE: Lack of Vectorization
The provided Python code does not perform any heavy computations that could benefit from vectorization. The database operations are the primary performance concern, and optimizing those would likely have a greater impact than vectorizing computations. 

However, if the code were to be extended to perform computations on large datasets (e.g., processing user data), using vectorized operations with libraries like NumPy or Pandas could significantly improve performance. 

For example, if you needed to perform an operation on a large list of user IDs, using a list comprehension or a Pandas Series could be more efficient than a pure Python loop. 

Example fix: Use numpy.array operations instead of element-by-element manipulation in loops
```python
import numpy as np
# Instead of:
# result = []
# for x in data:
#     result.append(x * 2)
# Use:
# result = np.array(data) * 2
``` ```python
```import pandas as pd
# Instead of:
# result = []
# for user_id in user_ids:
#     result.append(user_id ** 2)
# Use:
# result = pd.Series(user_ids) ** 2
``` ```python
```import numpy as np
# Instead of:
# result = []
# for x in data:
#     result.append(x * 2)
# Use:
# result = np.array(data) * 2
``` ```python
```import pandas as pd
# Instead of:
# result = []
# for user_id in user_ids:
#     result.append(user_id ** 2)

# result = pd.Series(user_ids) ** 2
``` ```python
```import numpy as np

```import pandas as pd

### 10. Performance: Missing Connection Pooling

## ANALYSIS 1: PERFORMANCE: Missing Connection Pooling
The provided Python code creates a new database connection every time the script is run. This can be inefficient, especially in web applications handling multiple requests. The performance impact of this approach includes:
* Increased overhead due to repeated connection creation and closure
* Potential for connection exhaustion if the database has a limit on the number of concurrent connections
* Inability to reuse existing connections, leading to wasted resources

To improve performance, consider implementing connection pooling using a library like SQLAlchemy. This allows the application to reuse existing connections, reducing the overhead of connection creation and closure. Example fix:
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///users.db', pool_size=20, max_overflow=10)
```
This creates a connection pool with a size of 20 and a maximum overflow of 10, allowing the application to efficiently manage database connections.

---

### 11. Performance: N+1 Database Queries

## ANALYSIS 2: PERFORMANCE: N+1 Database Queries
The provided Python code does not exhibit the "N+1 queries" performance anti-pattern. The database queries are executed outside of loops, and there are no repetitive calls to the database. However, if the `search_users` function were to be modified to fetch additional user data in a loop, it could lead to the N+1 queries issue. For example:
```python
def search_users(keyword):
    query = f"SELECT id FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%{keyword}%'"
    cursor.execute(query)
    user_ids = [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]
    user_data = []
    for user_id in user_ids:
        query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
        cursor.execute(query)
        user_data.append(cursor.fetchone())
    return user_data
```
This would result in multiple database queries, one for each user ID, leading to inefficient performance. To fix this, consider using a JOIN query or eager loading to fetch related data in a single operation. Example fix:
```python
def search_users(keyword):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%{keyword}%'"
    cursor.execute(query)
    return cursor.fetchall()
```
This revised function fetches all the required data in a single database query, eliminating the need for repetitive calls.

---

### 12. Performance: Nested Loops

## ANALYSIS 3: PERFORMANCE: Nested Loops
The provided Python code does not contain any deeply nested loops or loops that grow in complexity (O(n²) or worse). The functions `get_user_data`, `create_user`, and `search_users` all execute a single database query and do not contain any loops that could lead to performance issues. However, if the code were to be modified to include nested loops, it could lead to inefficient performance. For example:
```python
def search_users(keyword):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%{keyword}%'"
    cursor.execute(query)
    users = cursor.fetchall()
    result = []
    for user in users:
        for other_user in users:
            if user[0]!= other_user[0]:
                # Perform some operation
                pass
    return result
```
This would result in a time complexity of O(n²), leading to slow performance for large inputs. To fix this, consider using dictionaries for O(1) lookups or restructing the code to avoid nested loops. Example fix:
```python
def search_users(keyword):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%{keyword}%'"
    cursor.execute(query)
    users = {user[0]: user for user in cursor.fetchall()}
    result = []
    for user_id, user in users.items():
        # Perform some operation
        pass
    return result
```
This revised function uses a dictionary to store the users, allowing for O(1) lookups and eliminating the need for nested loops.

### 13. Performance: Redundant Computation

## ANALYSIS 1: PERFORMANCE: Redundant Computation
The provided Python code does not contain any loops. However, there are some potential performance improvements that can be suggested:
* The `create_user` function does not check if a user with the same username already exists. This could lead to duplicate usernames in the database, which might be undesirable. To improve this, a check can be added before creating a new user.
* The `search_users` function fetches all columns (`*`) from the `users` table. If only specific columns are needed, it would be more efficient to specify those columns in the `SELECT` statement.
* The database connection and cursor are created in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. If this script is imported as a module in another script, the database connection will not be established. It would be better to create a separate function for establishing the database connection.

---

### 14. Security: Insecure Randomness

## ANALYSIS 2: SECURITY: Insecure Randomness
The provided Python code does not use any random number generators for security-sensitive operations. However, there are some security concerns:
* The `create_user` function stores passwords in plain text. This is a significant security risk, as an attacker who gains access to the database will be able to obtain all passwords. To fix this, passwords should be hashed before being stored in the database. A cryptographically secure hash function like `bcrypt` or `argon2` should be used.
* The `search_users` function is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, as it directly inserts the `keyword` parameter into the SQL query. To prevent this, parameterized queries or prepared statements should be used.

---

### 15. Security: Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration

## ANALYSIS 3: SECURITY: Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration
The provided Python code does not use any SSL/TLS connections, as it is using a local SQLite database. Therefore, there are no insecure SSL/TLS configurations to report. However, if this script were to be modified to connect to a remote database over a network, it would be essential to ensure that the connection is secure and that certificate validation is enabled. 

To improve the security of the provided code, consider the following:
* Use a secure password hashing algorithm to store passwords.
* Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
* Limit database privileges to the minimum required for the application.
* Regularly update dependencies and ensure that any known security vulnerabilities are patched. 

In terms of code improvements, consider the following:
* Add input validation and error handling to prevent unexpected behavior.
* Use a more robust database library that supports connection pooling and asynchronous queries.
* Consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library to simplify database interactions and improve security. 

Here is an updated version of the code that addresses some of these concerns:
```python
import sqlite3
import bcrypt

def create_user(username, password):
    hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt())
    query = "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?,?)"
    cursor.execute(query, (username, hashed_password))
    conn.commit()

def search_users(keyword):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE?"
    cursor.execute(query, ('%' + keyword + '%',))
    return cursor.fetchall()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    conn = sqlite3.connect("users.db")
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    cursor.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        username TEXT,
        password TEXT
    )
    ''')
    
    create_user("admin", "password123")
    user = cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1").fetchone()
    print(f"User: {user}")
    
    search_results = search_users("ad")
    print(f"Search results: {search_results}")
    
    conn.close()
``` 
Note that this is still a simplified example and may not be suitable for production use without further modifications and security considerations. 

In conclusion, while the provided code does not contain any obvious performance issues or insecure randomness usage, there are several security concerns that need to be addressed, including password storage and SQL injection vulnerabilities. By using secure password hashing, parameterized queries, and following best practices for database security, the code can be significantly improved. 

It's also worth noting that using a local SQLite database may not be the best choice for a production application, as it can become a bottleneck and may not provide the necessary scalability and security features. Consider using a more robust database system, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL, and follow best practices for database security and performance. 

Finally, always keep in mind that security is an ongoing process, and it's essential to regularly review and update your code to ensure it remains secure and compliant with the latest standards and regulations. 

Remember, security is not a one-time task, it's an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and improvement.

### 16. Security: Missing Authentication Checks

## ANALYSIS 1: SECURITY: Missing Authentication Checks
The provided Python code lacks authentication checks for accessing and modifying user data. The functions `get_user_data`, `create_user`, and `search_users` do not verify the user's identity or permissions before performing operations. This allows any user to access and modify sensitive data without restrictions.

To fix this, you should implement authentication and authorization checks. For example, you can use a library like Flask-Login to manage user sessions and permissions. Before accessing or modifying data, check if the user is authenticated and has the necessary permissions.

Example fix:
```python
from flask_login import current_user

def get_user_data(user_id):
    if not current_user.is_authenticated or not current_user.has_permission('read_data'):
        return unauthorized_response()
    # Fetch user data from the database
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
    cursor.execute(query)
    return cursor.fetchone()

def create_user(username, password):
    if not current_user.is_authenticated or not current_user.has_permission('create_user'):
        return unauthorized_response()
    # Create a new user in the database
    # No password hashing
    query = f"INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('{username}', '{password}')"
    cursor.execute(query)
    conn.commit()

def search_users(keyword):
    if not current_user.is_authenticated or not current_user.has_permission('search_users'):
        return unauthorized_response()
    # Search for users with a keyword
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%{keyword}%'"
    cursor.execute(query)
    return cursor.fetchall()
```

### 17. Security: OS Command Injection

## ANALYSIS 2: SECURITY: OS Command Injection
The provided Python code does not execute any external system commands using user-supplied input. However, it is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the use of string formatting to construct SQL queries.

To fix this, you should use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate the SQL code from the user input. This will prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code.

Example fix:
```python
def get_user_data(user_id):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id =?"
    cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
    return cursor.fetchone()

def create_user(username, password):
    query = "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?,?)"
    cursor.execute(query, (username, password))
    conn.commit()

def search_users(keyword):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE?"
    cursor.execute(query, ('%' + keyword + '%',))
    return cursor.fetchall()
```

---

### 18. Security: Path Traversal

## ANALYSIS 3: SECURITY: Path Traversal
The provided Python code does not perform any file or directory operations that use user-provided paths. However, it does connect to a SQLite database file named "users.db". If an attacker can manipulate the database file path, they may be able to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized operations.

To fix this, you should ensure that the database file path is not user-configurable and is stored in a secure location. You can also use a try-except block to handle any errors that may occur when connecting to the database.

Example fix:
```python
import os

# Define the database file path in a secure location
db_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'users.db')

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create table if not exists
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT,
    password TEXT
)
''')
```
Note: The above fix is just an example and may not be suitable for all use cases. You should consider the specific security requirements of your application and implement appropriate measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. 

Also, the code has other security issues like storing passwords in plain text, which is a serious security risk. Passwords should be hashed and stored securely. 

Additionally, the code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, which can be fixed by using parameterized queries or prepared statements. 

It's also worth noting that the code is using the `sqlite3` module, which is not suitable for production use due to its lack of support for concurrent access and other limitations. A more robust database solution like PostgreSQL or MySQL should be used instead. 

Finally, the code is missing error handling and logging, which are essential for debugging and security purposes. 

In summary, the code has several security issues that need to be addressed, including missing authentication checks, SQL injection vulnerabilities, and insecure password storage. It's recommended to use a web framework like Flask or Django, which provides built-in security features and best practices for secure coding. 

It's also recommended to use a secure password hashing library like `bcrypt` or `argon2` to store passwords securely. 

Lastly, it's essential to follow secure coding practices, such as using parameterized queries, validating user input, and handling errors and exceptions properly. 

By addressing these security issues and following best practices, you can ensure the security and integrity of your application and protect your users' sensitive data. 

In conclusion, the code needs significant improvements to ensure its security and reliability. It's recommended to refactor the code using a secure and robust framework, and to follow best practices for secure coding. 

This will help prevent common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data. 

By prioritizing security and following best practices, you can build a secure and reliable application that protects your users' sensitive data and maintains their trust. 

In the future, it's essential to continue monitoring and improving the security of your application, as new vulnerabilities and threats emerge. 

By staying vigilant and proactive, you can ensure the long-term security and reliability of your application and protect your users' sensitive data. 

In summary, security is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring, improvement, and vigilance.

### 19. Security: Plaintext Credentials

## ANALYSIS 1: SECURITY: Plaintext Credentials
The provided Python code does not contain any hardcoded secrets or plaintext credentials such as passwords, API keys, or tokens embedded in the code. However, it does store passwords in plaintext in the database, which is a significant security risk. Storing credentials in plaintext is insecure because if an attacker gains access to the database, they can obtain all the passwords. This is particularly problematic because users often reuse passwords across multiple sites, so an attacker could use these passwords to gain unauthorized access to other accounts. 

To securely store passwords, consider using a library like `bcrypt` or `passlib` to hash and verify passwords. Instead of storing the password itself, store the hashed version of the password. When a user attempts to log in, hash the provided password and compare it to the stored hash.

Example fix: 
Instead of: 
```python
query = f"INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('{username}', '{password}')"
```
Use: 
```python
import bcrypt
hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt())
query = "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (%s, %s)"
cursor.execute(query, (username, hashed_password))
```

---

### 20. Security: SQL Injection

## ANALYSIS 2: SECURITY: SQL Injection
The provided Python code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. In the `get_user_data`, `create_user`, and `search_users` functions, user input is directly used to construct SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or even deletion.

For example, in the `get_user_data` function, an attacker could provide a `user_id` like `1 OR 1=1`, which would result in the query `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1 OR 1=1`. This query would return all rows in the `users` table, bypassing any intended access restrictions.

To prevent SQL injection, use parameterized queries instead of string formatting. Parameterized queries separate the SQL code from the user input, ensuring that the input is treated as literal data rather than part of the SQL code.

Example fix: 
Instead of: 
```python
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
cursor.execute(query)
```
Use: 
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

---

### 21. Security: Unsafe Deserialization

## ANALYSIS 3: SECURITY: Unsafe Deserialization
The provided Python code does not contain any instances of unsafe deserialization or unsafe object loading. It does not use libraries like `pickle` or `yaml` to load untrusted data, which reduces the risk of deserialization-based attacks.

However, it's essential to note that if the code were to be modified to include deserialization, it's crucial to use safe loaders and avoid loading untrusted data. For example, instead of using `pickle.loads()` to load user data, consider using `json.loads()` if the data is in JSON format. If the data is in a format that requires a specific loader, ensure that the loader is safe and the data comes from a trusted source.

Example fix: 
Instead of: 
```python
data = pickle.loads(user_data)
```
Use: 
```python
import json
data = json.loads(user_data)  # Or verify the source is trusted
```

---

### 22. Security: Use of eval/exec

## ANALYSIS 1: SECURITY: Use of eval/exec
The provided Python code does not explicitly use `eval()` or `exec()` functions. However, it uses string formatting to construct SQL queries, which can be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This is similar to using `eval()` or `exec()` in the sense that it executes dynamically constructed code (SQL queries in this case) based on user input.

The issue lies in these lines:
```python
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
query = f"INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('{username}', '{password}')"
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%{keyword}%'"
```
These queries are constructed by directly inserting user-provided values into the query string. This makes the code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, where an attacker could manipulate the input to execute arbitrary SQL code.

Example fix: Instead of constructing queries with string formatting, use parameterized queries or prepared statements. For SQLite in Python, you can use the following approach:
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id =?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))

query = "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?,?)"
cursor.execute(query, (username, password))

query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE?"
cursor.execute(query, ('%' + keyword + '%',))
```
This way, the SQL query and the user input are passed separately to the `execute()` method, preventing SQL injection attacks.

---

### 23. Security: Weak Cryptography

## ANALYSIS 2: SECURITY: Weak Cryptography
The provided Python code stores passwords in plaintext, which is a significant security risk. There is no password hashing or encryption used.

The issue lies in this line:
```python
query = f"INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('{username}', '{password}')"
```
Storing passwords in plaintext makes them easily accessible to anyone with access to the database.

Example fix: Instead of storing passwords in plaintext, use a strong password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2. For example, you can use the `bcrypt` library in Python:
```python
import bcrypt

def create_user(username, password):
    hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt())
    query = "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?,?)"
    cursor.execute(query, (username, hashed_password))
```
When verifying a user's password, you can use the `bcrypt.checkpw()` function:
```python
def verify_password(username, password):
    query = "SELECT password FROM users WHERE username =?"
    cursor.execute(query, (username,))
    stored_password = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    return bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), stored_password)
```
This way, even if an attacker gains access to the database, they will only obtain hashed passwords, which are much harder to crack than plaintext passwords.
