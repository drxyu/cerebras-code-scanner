I've reviewed the scan results and made several improvements to the `cerebras_code_scanner.py` file based on the security and performance recommendations. Here are the key changes:

### Security Improvements:

1. **Path Traversal Protection**:
   - Added proper path normalization using `os.path.abspath()` and `os.path.normpath()` to prevent path traversal attacks
   - Applied this to file paths, output file paths, and when handling command line arguments

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved error handling throughout the code with proper exception catching
   - Added proper error handling for file operations with specific error messages
   - Wrapped the main function in a try-except block to catch any uncaught exceptions

3. **Logging**:
   - Replaced print statements with proper logging using the Python `logging` module
   - Added formatting to log messages with timestamps and log levels
   - Used appropriate log levels (info, error) for different types of messages

4. **API Key Security**:
   - Added a proper error when no API key is found instead of continuing with None
   - Added explicit error messages to guide users when API keys are missing

5. **File Handling**:
   - Added explicit encoding (UTF-8) when reading and writing files
   - Added error handling for file operations
   - Sanitized output file paths

### Other Improvements:

1. **Return Codes**:
   - Modified `main()` to return proper exit codes (0 for success, 1 for error)
   - Used `sys.exit()` with the return code from main

2. **Structure**:
   - Better organization of code with proper function documentation
   - More consistent parameter validation

These changes address all the major security issues identified in the scan results, including path traversal vulnerabilities, improper error handling, and information leakage concerns. The code now follows better security practices without changing its core functionality.
